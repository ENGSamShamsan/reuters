{"codes":["E12","ECAT"],"headline":"China interest rate cut not likely in short term.","text":"\nChina is likely to keep bank interest rates at current levels for the foreseeable future, despite low inflation, mainly because of a slowdown in savings, banking analysts said on Tuesday.\nThe central bank could instead prefer to cut bank reserve ratios as an alternative way of offsetting the impact of falling inflation, the analysts said.\nFalls in retail price inflation to a year-on-year 6.1 percent in mid-1996 from record highs of 21 percent in 1994 led to two interest rate cuts in May and August last year.\nInflation had fallen to an official year-on-year 1.8 percent in the first half of 1997 and there had been hopes of another interest rate cut, analysts said.\nBut slower bank deposit growth made this highly unlikely, a banker with a major Chinese state bank said.\n\"As all Chinese banks are state owned, most industrial firms still rely on bank loans, instead of raising money through the market,\" another banking source said.\n\"This reliance means the central bank cannot cut interest rates without considering the impact this would have on bank deposits,\" he said.\nFigures from the central bank show that individual bank deposits grew 19.65 percent in the first half of 1997, compared with an increase of 37.7 percent for all of 1996, the Financial News said on Tuesday.\nLast year's two cuts brought interest rates down by 2.48 percentage points on average, with the rate for one-year bank deposits now at 7.47 percent from 9.15 percent in May 1996. Bank interest rates were now the lowest since 1990, analysts said.\nRecent monthly surveys by the central bank of bank account holders have found that 34.5 percent of respondents prefer to put their money in long-term fixed deposits, official media have reported. This figure was down by 4.5 percentage points compared with the year-ago period, reports said.\n\"Even if the macro-economy improves further, the central bank may use the chance to adjust the whole banking system and a bank reserve ratio cut is more likely to come before an interest rate cut,\" the first banker said.\nBeijing now asks banks to put aside 13 percent of their deposits for central reserves and another five to seven percent for their own reserves.\nThese ratios had not changed for nine years and lagged far behind economic development, analysts said.\nThe ratio cut, promised by the central bank in July 1996, has yet to be implemented partly because the surging stock markets had made authorities nervous about allowing more cash into the system, analysts said.\nBankers said they had no idea when ratios would be cut and cited a number of likely reasons, including rampant share speculation, for the delay.\n\"The central bank will not cut the bank interest rates in the short term for fear of fanning stock speculation again,\" a stock analyst with a major Chinese brokerage said.\nOther factors included slow sales of state debt this year because of the debt's falling coupons after the 1996 rate cuts, analysts said.\nChina has said it plans to issue a record of around 250 billion yuan in state debt this year to cover state deficits and redeem maturing debt.

He also contacted me and sometimes we talked through video conferencing,\" Mahathir said.\nAnwar kept a high profile while his mentor was abroad.\nHe stepped up an anti-corruption campaign, sacking a deputy minister and several politicians from Mahathir's United Malays National Organisation. He also installed two state chief ministers, announced a minor cabinet shuffle and dominated the headlines with visits around the country.\n\"Many of the decisions, I have a feeling, were made earlier by Mahathir and Anwar was just carrying them out,\" said political commentator Rustam Sani.\n\"I feel Mahathir was there all through those two months.\"\nBut with the top cat away, Anwar also found himself refereeing some intramural disputes in the government.\nThe head of the organising committee for next year's Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur quit in a huff last month after criticism from two cabinet ministers. He un-resigned the following day after meeting Anwar.\nThen the national police chief angrily denied allegations from National Unity and Social Development Minister Zaleha Ismail that police officers often tell women who report violent acts that domestic problems should be solved at home.\nThese and several other public spats prompted Anwar to ask ministers to refrain from going public with their disputes.\nThe markets have not been very kind to Anwar, who is also the Finance Minister.\nThe stock market first hit the skids in April when the announcement of Mahathir's trip abroad caused investors worried about the prime minister's health to dump shares.\nAs it happened, Mahathir was the picture of health and vigour as he flitted about the globe visiting Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Hungary, Turkey, Lebanon, Argentina and Japan.\nBut Thailand's financial crisis and political turmoil in Cambodia helped spark a renewed sell-off of Malaysian stocks this month. At the same time, currency speculators, attacked regional currencies including the ringgit, pushing it to a 38-month low against the dollar.\n\"I think he's done fairly well,\" said Bruce Gale, regional manager of the Hong Kong-based Political and Economic Risk Consultancy. \"If you were to grade him like pass, fail or credit, I'd give him a credit.\"\nAnalysts say that Anwar still has to shake an image of being woolly-minded and indecisive.\nThey cite the confusion that reigned for more than a day over whether the Cabinet, at a meeting chaired by Anwar in late March, had decided to \"freeze ties\" with Singapore during a row over remarks by Singapore's former prime minister that offended Kuala Lumpur. Mahathir, who was then on a visit to Tokyo, ruled that was not the case.\nMore recently, another government decision requiring all schools to teach a compulsory course in Islamic civilisation revived fears that Anwar, who began his career as leader of an Islamic youth movement, was a fundamentalist in disguise.\nAfter two weeks of hand-wringing debate and vocal criticism from Malaysia's Chinese community, the education minister announced the course would be on both Islamic and Asian civilisations.\n\"On both of these issues, he could have quickly cleared the air because he was in the best position to do that,\" Gale said, adding that Anwar's perceived vacillations remain a concern in the business community.\n","classes":[90,104,105],"classes_pad":null}

It's no longer easy to bring in diesel through this channel,\" said a trader with China National United Oil Corp (China Oil), one of China's state oil importers.  \nChina has operated a crack down on oil product smuggling all year. Its latest move involves targeting firms with foreign shareholders which are allowed to import diesel, Chinese sources said.\nChina allows foreign-invested firms in five special economic zones -- Shenzhen, Xiamen, Shantou, Zhuhai and Hainan -- to import low-tariff diesel for their own use.\nBy the end of 1996, there were 39,504 foreign-invested firms in the five zones, a State Council official said.  \nBut the government says many of the foreign-invested companies sold the diesel into domestic markets for a profit, abusing the privilages offered by the government, Chinese officials said.\nSelling on imports became lucrative because the price of imported diesel fell below domestic prices in many areas.\nA source with China National Chemicals Import and Export Corp (SINOCHEM), another state importer, said diesel import curbs on foreign-invested companies started in late June and were likely to last through the second half of the year.  \n\"We've received various reports from the State Council repeating that current diesel stocks must be consumed first, which means companies in economic zones must buy from domestic refineries, instead of importing themselves,\" the source said.\n\"It's not (that) they can not import but they must have very good reasons,\" said the source, adding that authorities would even trace the diesel after granting approval to ensure the oil did not flow into domestic markets.\nFigures for diesel imports by foreign-invested firms were not available but several Chinese sources noted such imports have dropped \"in large scales.\"  \n\"It has been very difficult for economic zones to get approval for diesel imports recently,\" said a source with China International United Petroleum and Chemicals Co (UNIPEC).\nThe source said China's processing crude imports could slow down in the second half if Chinese refineries cut down their diesel production in the face of high stocks.\n\"So far our crude imports are still normal, but the high diesel stocks are a big concern,\" the UNIPEC source said.  \nAmid high diesel stocks since early 1997, China has stopped issuing fresh diesel import licences for the third quarter and traders said the cut back could last throughout the year unless diesel stocks fall.\nChinese traders said it would take two months to absorb China's current diesel stocks if no new imports were allowed.\nChina imported huge amount of diesel late 1996 after using up its own diesel stocks when international diesel prices hit five-year highs.  \nStrong imports continued into the first half of 1997 and rampant smuggling as well as a state policy to encourage more diesel production further piled up diesel stocks at refineries.\n\"Diesel sold from economic zones is another reason diesel stocks are so high. It seems this time the government is determined to take action,\" the SINOCHEM source said.\n-- Singapore Newsroom (65 870 3571)\n","classes":[13,33,34,44,119,122,123],"classes_pad":null}

A Petronas spokesman declined to comment on the proposed deal.\nOn Sunday, the official Iranian news agency IRNA said Iran planned $4 billion in industrial investments, including the refinery, liquefied petroleum depots and a cement plant.\nAn Iranian delegation signed a memorandum of agreement with Philippine investors to pursure various industry projects.  \nMindanao island, the second biggest in the country, is the ancestral homeland of Moslems in the Philippines and has a population of five million.\nMoslems are fighting a separatist war, but last year the biggest group, the Moro National Liberation Front, signed a peace accord with the government.\nIts leader Nur Misuari has aggressively courted Moslem countries to assist in the rebuilding of the island.  \nPetronas is already beefing up its presence in Mindanao through the construction of a liquified petroleum gas (LPG) bottling plant which is expected to be operational at the end of this year, a company spokesman said.\nPetronas currently only distributes LPG in the area.\nEarlier this month, Petronas said it had taken up a 20 percent interest in a 250,000 tonnes-per-year polyethylene plant that is expected to start up in 1999 in Bataan, northern Philippines.  \nPetronas is also involved in oil exploration in the Philippines where it has a partnership with the Philippine National Oil Company-Exploration Corp to explore for oil in Cotabato, also in the south.\nThe company is seeking to set up a chain of petrol stations in Mindanao.\n\"We have planned to set up retail in Mindanao in the Philippines,\" president and chief executive officer Hassan Marican told Reuters in June.\nPetronas currently runs 12 service stations in Phnom Penh in Cambodia and two in Bangkok.  \nIndustry sources said Petronas has targetted the Mindanao area for investment as part of its expansion into the Southeast Asian market.\nThe company is still in talks with Vietnam to build the country's first oil refinery.\n\"We made known we are still keen on the project.

Imports fell by 0.1 percent to $63.05 billion.\nIndustrial output for the first six months was up 11.6 percent while fixed-asset investment was up 13.5 percent compared with the year ago period, Ye said.\nBut China faced many problems in its drive to transform itself into an economic powerhouse, such as rising stockpiles and an inefficient state sector, whose losses rose by 9.2 percent in the half to 67.4 billion yuan, he said.\nProfits of profitable state enterprises were just 6.0 billion yuan in the half, he said.\n\"Some enterprises are having economic difficulties and have seen output decline or are not running at capacity and have sent home many workers,\" Ye said.\nBut officials forecast even higher growth for the year despite Beijing's earlier worries that an overheating economy could plunge China back into an inflationary nightmare.\nGrowth \"should be around last year's level of about 10 percent or so\", said bureau economist Qiu Xiaohua. China's GDP grew by 9.8 percent in 1996.\nA government think-tank recently said GDP would grow by 10.3 percent this year, surpassing the 9.0 to 9.5 percent estimate of a senior central banker and Premier Li's target of 8.0 percent.\n\"We can say between nine and 10 percent is normal,\" Qiu said. \"A point above or below the official target is no problem.\"\nEconomists have said China's success in bringing benchmark retail price inflation down to 1.8 percent in the half could spur growth later in the year if Beijing eased credit to the state sector, but Ye said no policy change was in sight.\n\"If we loosen macrocontrol of the economy, many funds will go to inefficient businesses or to enterprises that make unsellable goods and lead to the overheating of the economy in the following period,\" he said.\nChina's retail price inflation fell to 6.1 percent last year -- down from 14.8 percent in 1995 and a communist-era high of 21.7 percent in 1994 -- after Beijing tightened credit to try to cool down the economy.\n","classes":[45,70],"classes_pad":null}

Our compatriots can set their hearts at ease,\" said spokesman Kung Fan-ting.\n\"Every year the Chinese communist navy conducts routine military exercises in major training sea zones, and such exercises are always given extensive coverage,\" Kung said.\nState-funded Taiwan television said defence officials had described the July 10-20 People's Liberation Army exercises as \"just a routine drill, involving no live fire\".\nThat description contrasted with Beijing's own assessment, issued on Monday by the China News Service, which said the PLA navy had mounted the \"biggest contest in military techniques at sea since the all-forces contest of 1964\".\nChina's East Sea fleet, tasked with defending the mainland's eastern seaboard, would be in the front line of any conflict with Japan or Chinese Nationalist Taiwan -- a well-armed thorn in Beijing's side since a 1949 civil war left them divided.\nThe fleet held more than a week of competitive reviews of its combat ability, the state-funded agency said.\nThe drills involved submarines, destroyers, escort vessels, landing craft and other ships and tested China's sailors on more than 100 drills, including use of guided missiles, torpedoes, rockets and underwater guided weapons, it said.\nTaiwan, which last put its military to test with live-fire games just days before Britain handed Hong Kong back to China on July 1, said Beijing's East China Sea drills \"had no political implications for the Hong Kong handover\".\nTaipei and Beijing have been rivals since 1949, when the Nationalist Republic of China and its army, routed on the mainland by communist forces, fled into exile on Taiwan.\nTwo decades of market reform have given Beijing the financial means to modernise its military, the world's largest at three million troops, prompting Taiwan in turn to spend billions to build one of Asia's most advanced armies.\nChina menaced Taiwan with repeated rounds of live-fire war games in the Taiwan strait over eight months in the run-up to the island's March 1996 presidential election, even firing unarmed missiles at targets outside Taiwan's main ports.\nBeijing, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province, said its intent was to snuff out support for an independent Taiwan and keep the island on track towards national reunion. Beijing vows to attack if the island seeks independence.\nTaiwan has said its June 22-24 Chinese Glory games, its first large-scale exercises in three years, were unrelated to Hong Kong despite their timing, though they gave Taiwan a chance to put its military prowess on dramatic display.\nAmong the weapons tested by Taiwan were F-16 and Mirage jet fighters, recently bought from the United States and France over Beijing's bitter protests, French-made radar-defying \"stealth\" frigates and refitted M60A3 tanks.\nTaipei displayed its new U.S.-made Patriot anti-missile missiles, bought to shoot down Beijing's ballistic missiles.\n","classes":[90,92,93],"classes_pad":null}

Consumption was expected to grow at a forecast 7.1 percent in 1997 and 8.1 percent in 1998\n\"We believe growth will remain stable at a high rate,\" said Clifford Herbert, secretary general in the Ministry of Finance.\n\"We still think our budget projection of growth around 8.0 percent will still be achieved, can be achieved,\" he told reporters after the MIER report was released.\nHe said the Commonwealth Games next year was not expected to be a major factor since much of the infrastructure investment had already been made. The games had been widely reported, including by MIER, as one reason for the forecast rise in growth.\nMIER said a recovery in exports this year, particularly because of revival in demand for semiconductors, was expected to help reduce the current account deficit.\n\"Overall, the current account balance is projected to see its deficit trimmed slightly to 12.5 billion ringgit ($4.8 billion) in 1997 but rising to 13.3 billion ringgit in 1998,\" MIER said.\nIn 1996, Malaysia's current account deficit was 13 billion ringgit, and the government has forecast the current year gap at 14.8 billion ringgit.\nMIER said Malaysia's exports in 1997 would grow by 6.3 percent and improve to 11.6 percent in 1998. Imports were forecast to rise by 6.0 percent and 11.5 percent, respectively.\n\"Inflation is forecast to be at 3.0 percent in 1997 and 3.2 percent in 1998,\" it said.\nHerbert said there was no fear of overheating in the economy since inflation was under control, pre-emptive measures were in place for the property and financial sectors and growth in the economy was broad-based, led by manufacturing sector.\nMIER said its business conditions survey in the second quarter of 1997 showed overall manufacturing sales grew at a brisk pace.\n\"Manufacturers were positive about the near-term export sale with the majority projecting an improvement in the next quarter,\" it said.\n\"Consumer sentiments were also buoyant,\" MIER said in its survey. \"More consumers perceived their financial position as having improved compared to six months ago.\"\nIt said consumers expressed greater confidence in the economy and expected job opportunities in the chronically labour short economy to improve further.\n\"Given the positive financial income position and employment outlook, consumers continued with their spending spree. Many viewed the present time as a good time to invest in housing and to purchase major consumer durable items,\" MIER said.

Nippon Television Network Corp was listed in 1959 and Tokyo Broadcasting System Inc in 1960.\nIt will also be the second unlisted firm after Oriental Land Co Ltd to directly list on the TSE's first section since the bourse relaxed its listing requirements in late 1996.\nOf the 200,000 new shares to be publicly offered, Fuji plans to auction 116,000 shares on July 29. It will also put up a total of 30,500 shares in a secondary offering.\nFuji has set a minimum price of 450,000 yen per share for the stock auction, but some analysts have predicted that the public offering price could be about 540,000 yen per share.\n-- Tokyo Equities Desk +81-3432-8595\n","classes":[14,15,18,20,21,44],"classes_pad":null}

What we're going to do is to specialise in our fields, provide high-value instruments and seek niche markets,\" Yoshihiko Miyauchi, Orix's president and group chief executive officer, told Reuters in a recent interview.\n\"Currently, we are not confident of doing the same things as banks and we don't have such capabilities.\"\nEstablished in Japan in 1964, Orix has extended its business into 24 countries and now has 143 subsidiaries at home and abroad.\nIts leasing services range from office equipment like copying machines, telephones and computers to big-ticket items like cars, ships and aircraft.\nAnalysts say investor enthusiasm for Orix can be attributed to the strength of its core business, which generates more than half of its profits, as well as its diversification into operations such as credit card services, consumer finance, broking and life insurance.\nThey say the firm's disclosure of earnings data in line with U.S. standards, rather than Japan's looser accounting rules, also makes its shares attractive to overseas investors. Orix estimates foreigners hold more than 30 percent of its shares.\nThe firm, owner of the Japanese professional baseball team Orix Blue Wave, is now limbering up for Japan's forthcoming waves of financial regulation, which are aimed at breaking down barriers between the country's banking, securities and insurance sectors by 2001.\nOn July 18 Orix announced it would launch consumer information services covering life insurance and financial instruments tailored to needs of individual customers.\nEarlier this year, one of Orix's U.S. subsidiaries and Banc One Corp, the 10th-largest regional bank in the United States, agreed to set up a joint venture to offer commercial mortgage services.\nOrix says it aims to gain experience in mortgage-backed securities in the United States and to launch such products in Japan and other parts of Asia, where the asset-backed securities market has not yet flourished.\nMiyauchi said Orix could not compete with banks, who are well-established in the area of basic financial services, but would focus instead on niche areas.\nDrawing on a culinary metaphor to explain his strategy, he said: \"Banks only sell plain steamed rice. We take plain rice and make top-quality rice crackers or rice wine.\"\nOrix posted a group net profit, based on U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules, of 19.04 billion yen ($164 million) in the fiscal year that ended on March 31.\nOn July 18, it raised its forecast for this year's group net profit to 21 billion yen ($181 million) from an initial estimate of 20 billion yen ($172 million).\nMiyauchi said Orix plans to finish writing off its bad loan holdings, which it estimates at 170 billion yen ($1.46 billion), by the end of this fiscal year.\n\"I expect our earnings to improve greatly after we finish writing off the loans,\" he said.\nOrix said that as of March 1997 it had boosted its loan-loss reserves to 117.567 billion yen ($1.01 billion) from 81.886 billion yen ($705 million) a year earlier.

Previously they were alotted two or four gallons of petrol a week depending on the make of their car.\n\"Our main purpose in introducing the new system is to help stabilise the petrol prices in the black market,\" the MPPE official said.\nUsually consumers have to turn to black market petrol -- easily available especially in the capital -- to meet their needs after their alloted quota ran out.\nThe black market petrol price has become a barometer of the economy and of inflation.

Tipsters are financially rewarded for information leading to successful prosecutions.\n\"The fantastic response by members of the public sends a clear signal to users of illegal software -- it is only a matter of time before we're alerted to their activities,\" Henshaw said.\n\"Already several companies have found to their cost that software theft is an expensive risk,\" he said.\nThe biggest settlement against a company caught using illegal software here was a HK$1 million payment by a local television set maker, the BSA said.\nThe settlement cash against an abuser normally includes legal costs, damages and replacement software.\nThe BSA ploughs the money back into the campaign.

{"codes":["C11","C21","CCAT"],"headline":"FEATURE - Israel's Delta Three pioneer Internet telephony.","text":"\nElie Wurtman, a youthful high-tech entrepreneur in Jerusalem, had a brainstorm two years ago when the first software products for voice communication over the Internet were launched.\nWurtman and partner Jacob Davidson, then in New York, thought how much more convenient it would be for callers if this cheap form of voice communication could be accessed by phone rather than a portable computer (PC).\n\"We thought the appeal to the mass market of this business would be much wider if it could be accessed from a plain old telephone,\" said Wurtman.\nEnter Delta Three Inc with Wurtman as chief executive.\nWurtman and Davidson, both U.S.-born, 20-something entrepreneurs, rounded up a team of engineers who pieced together bits of existing software with new technology. The result is an Internet telephony service that allows subscribers to make cheap long-distance calls without a PC.\nThe system converts standard voice to digital format, breaking down data into multiple packets and routing it over the Internet. At destination, packets are converted back into analog format and transferred to the local public telephone network and over to the number dialled.\n\"A year ago Delta Three launched its first test product with a service to Israel from Russia that focused on Israel's immigrant community,\" Wurtman said.\nToday, the company has 12 sites in the United States, Europe, South America and Asia.\nSIGNIFICANT SAVINGS, WITH SOME DRAWBACKS\nCalls routed over the Internet amount to savings of about 70 percent for the caller. A call from the United States to Israel, for example, costs just $0.20 a minute 24 hours a day against about $0.90 via a regular service.\nThe main drawback is a slight delay in transmission in comparison to regular international calls, which Wurtman equates to the difference between flying economy and business class.\nAlso, the service takes in only areas covered by Delta Three's network.\nDelta Three, based in Jerusalem and New York, is doubling every month the minutes it carries and revenue generated. It expects to continue growing at this rate for the next year.\nIt has invested more than $1 million and is considering going public on the Nasdaq (North American Securities Dealers' Automated Quotations) in the next year.\nDelta Three is also seeking joint technology ventures and strategic alliances with major telecommunications companies.\nBy 2001 Internet telephony will account for 20 billion minutes of voice communication a year and Delta Three is well positioned to conquer a large share of the market, according to Wurtman.\n\"We have a lead time of nine to 12 months because of our early entry into this new arena. By coming in early we can establish ourselves as one of the major players.\"\nWurtman and Davidson believe the giant telecommunications companies will not remain indifferent to this phenomenon for long and are more likely to hook up with a company like Delta Three than spend time crafting their own technology.\n\"It's not worth it for companies like AT&T to develop their own technology. The major companies are too big to move quickly,\" said Davidson.\nEarlier this month Delta Three took a step towards its goal of becoming a global network. RSL Communications Ltd, an international carrier established by cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder, agreed to acquire a 51 percent stake in Delta Three for $10 million in cash and services.\n\"With RSL we double the size of our network,\" Wurtman said.\nSeeking to cash in on the global trend of telephony deregulation, RSL is building a traditional switch-based network. It has 13 sites so far with near-term plans for several more.\nEight months ago RSL gave Delta Three a challenge -- to set up a network to compete in the U.S.-Colombia route. In two weeks Delta Three was set up in the South American country.\nRSL was attracted to Delta for two reasons. \"Packet switching is the technology of the future,\" said Nir Tarlovsky, RSL's vice president of business development.\n\"It represents a more efficient way of passing traffic than traditional voice. Delta Three is one of the few that actually uses it and is not just testing it,\" Tarlovsky said in a telephone interview from New York that was carried by Delta Three.\nWhile RSL is building a voice network, it wants to have access to the new packet switching technology. \"We want to be ready once the quality is there to replace voice,\" Tarlovsky said.\nMore immediately, Delta Three gives RLS an advantage in reducing costs in places where conventional telephone service is still highly regulated.\nRSL believes many of these countries will not regulate voice over the Internet, Tarlovsky said.\nWhile Delta Three can charge rock bottom rates where it has a site, through RSL's network it can provide inexpensive service while it expands, Wurtman said.\nIn Israel, where two multinational consortia began operating overseas dialling services this month to compete with state monopoly Bezeq Israel Telecom, Delta Three's request for a licence to carry out beta tests six months ago was turned down.\n\"Now we received verbal indication that the official policy may be changing,\" Wurtman said.\nMeanwhile, the company was given a green light from the Israeli Communications Ministry to negotiate with Bezeq and its two new competitors to carry their traffic.\nWurtman said the winners of Israel's international phone tender cannot make a profit charging the rates they do using traditional switching.\n\"With Delta Three they can make money.\"\n","classes":[11,29,44],"classes_pad":null}

The authorities are still unable to identify whether they are civilians kidnapped by armed gangs, or terrorists,\" El Watan newspaper said.\nThe offensive began 10 days ago when a kidnapped woman escaped her rebel abductors and tipped off government forces on the gunmen's whereabouts, the newspaper said.\nAbout 20 rebels had attacked a hamlet near an underground guerrilla base in Attatba area of Blida province, about 50 km (about 30 miles) south of Algiers, the newspaper said.\nThey cut the throats of three women in the attack and abducted the woman, who was handed over to the assailants' leader for sexual abuse, El Watan said.\n\"At the end of the attack, a gang chief leading the assailants ordered a gunman to cut open a slain woman's thorax and eat her heart. Indeed, he ate the woman's heart before the eyes of horrified women and children,\" it added.\nThe security forces have so far killed about 140 rebels in their slow offensive hampered by the rugged area, El Watan said.\nThe guerrillas were members of gangs operating in the Algiers Moslem fundamentalist stronghold of Bab el Oued, Sidi Moussa area in Blida region and Kolea in the coastal province of Tipaza, some 60 km (40 miles) southwest of Algiers, it said.\nThey had gone to the area to attend a congress to plan strategy.\nEL Watan did not say to which rebel organisations the guerrillas belonged.\nL'Authentique newspaper, giving a slightly different version of the huge operation, said on Monday they were members of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA).\nL'Authentique said GIA chief Antar Zouabri might be among the trapped rebels.

All of its resources can thereby be focused on core operations,\" said Chief Executive Leif Johansson\nThe company posted an operating profit of 3.95 billion crowns in the first six months of the year compared to 2.28 billion in the same 1996 period. Net sales rose to 89.02 billion crowns from 78.06 billion.\nVolvo said positive currency effects totalled one billion crowns, taking futures and options contracts into account.\nJohansson vowed to turn around loss-making truck operations in North America, in the red for the second quarter running.\n\"Major rationalisation and cost-saving programmes have been instituted but have not yet had full effect. Aggressive improvements must continue,\" Johansson said.\nGustaf von Essen, a Volvo analyst at brokerage Carnegie, said the truck division's operating profit, at 688 million crowns, was below his expectations of 860 million crowns.\n\"It probably means more restructruing costs than were estimated and perhaps more price pressure in Europe than what we had thought,\" he told Reuters.\nSome analysts say Johansson, who took over the helm earlier this year after three years as head of Swedish appliance maker AB Electrolux, was dragging his feet in doing something about the trucks unit.\n\"This is what he said for the second quarter so now it's a little bit hard to judge. No doubt it's taking longer than expected,\" von Essen told Reuters.\nVon Essen said he had changed his forecast and now expected changes from the restructuring programme to filter through only in the final quarter of 1997 instead of in the third quarter as he believed at the start of this year.\nAnalysts say Volvo is probably looking at candidates for a possible takeover, with most fingers pointing to Pennsylvania-based Mack Trucks Inc. which is owned by French automaker Renault SA.\nPerformance of the car division was more-or-less in line with expectations. Operating profit for its car division rose to 2.15 billion crowns from 187 million a year earlier.\nJames Capel analyst Graham Philips said the group's result was slightly better than his expectations, but he was a little disappointed with the performance of the car division.\n\"We thought Volvo Cars would have been slightly better in the second quarter since we believed currency and volume effects would have affected the profit more,\" Philips said.\nVolvo said the total market for passenger cars declined slightly during the first half of the year, with the North American market down by approximately four percent and the European market flat.\nThe Japanese market increased by five percent but this was mainly in the first quarter.

Economists said it was a disappointment and highlighted the continued fragility of economic growth in France.\nNational statistics institute INSEE said industrial production fell 1.6 percent from April and manufacturing output, which excludes energy, agri-food businesses and construction, dropped 1.7 percent.\nYear-on-year, production rose 2.2 percent while manufacturing output was up 3.1 percent.\nThe decline in May was partly explained as a correction to April's strong output rise and seasonal factors.

He said he expected the tax rise to dent corporate confidence somewhat.\nForeign demand would remain the driving factor behind output, economists said.\nThe drop in the car sector had a spillover effect into semi-finished goods and industrial capital goods, Mange said. Some car parts are counted as semi-finished goods and corporate car purchases are often counted as capital investments he said.\nProduction dropped 3.2 percent in the car sector, 1.7 percent in semi-finished goods and 1.2 percent in the industrial capital goods sector.\nOutput was also lower in consumer goods, agri-food businesses, energy and construction.\n","classes":[58,59,70],"classes_pad":null}

They have been held under house arrest during the trial.\nNeither Hass nor Priebke were present for the morning's brief hearing before the court formally adjourned until 12.30 p.m. (1030 GMT). The men were not expected in court later.\nThe prosecution has demanded a life sentence for Priebke and 24 years for Hass, saying Priebke's crimes were aggravated by cruelty, brutality and premeditation while Hass could claim mitigating circumstances.\nLawyers for the civil plaintiffs, who include the families of 75 Jews killed at the caves, want five life sentences each for the two Germans. The defence wants them to be set free.\nPriebke, who was extradited from Argentina in November, 1995, where he had lived openly for nearly half a century, has also admitted to ticking names off a list as the victims were brought to the caves.\nSecurity at the courtroom and the Roman Catholic monastery where Priebke has been held was stepped up ahead of the verdict to try to avoid a repetition of the uproar which broke out at the end of Priebke's first trial on August 1 last year.\nOn that occasion, a military court found him guilty of complicity but not punishable under a statute of limitations.\nProtestors laid siege to the courtroom preventing Priebke from leaving. He was rearrested a few hours later and the verdict was quashed on appeal.\nHass, a reluctant prosecution witness in Priebke's first trial when he testified from a hospital bed after he injured himself trying to flee and avoid giving evidence, was brought to trial himself after admitting his own role in the massacre.\nThe Union of Jewish Communities said it had asked Rome mayor Francesco Rutelli to be present in court to hear the verdict.

It's quite an erratic number, but overall it appears to be on an upward trend.\nIn terms of markets, I doubt it's going to have much effect at all.

There's some scepticism in the markets about political interference in the (audit) numbers.  \nERIC MULLER, ECONOMIST, UBS\nI was expecting a correction after April's figures but it is a little bigger than I expected, mainly because of a weaker automobile component than I forecast but also because of semi-finished goods whose fall was double what I expected.\nWe should not use one month to determine the trend...The first half has been somewhat stronger on average than predicted but for the second half, things risk being less clear. Foreign demand remains the major factor (in driving production).\nToday, the new elements are the audit and the tax measures that take effect from 1997. Domestically, there will be a small fall in confidence (as a result of the higher taxes on companies in the government's deficit-fighting package).  \nPATRICK MANGE, ECONOMIST, DEUTSCHE BANK.\nIt's very disappointing and a little surprising. We had been following the monthly surveys of sentiment that indicated sustained production for that month and was it hard to predict such a sharp drop.\nApril rose strongly and this could mean that May is a correction.\nBut all the elements fell and it could be some political fears crept in. In May we were in the middle of the election campaign and maybe corporations were waiting for the results of the election to step up production.\nThere are also seasonal factors to consider.\nProduction will remain weak in June but if you look at the year trend or the six month trend, it is well oriented.\n-- Paris Newsroom +331 4221 5452\n","classes":[58,59,70],"classes_pad":null}

{"codes":["M12","MCAT"],"headline":"Firmer Bunds and futures begin Greenspan vigil.","text":"\nGerman debt markets would need an unexpected jolt on Tuesday to push them out of rather subdued trading ranges.\nBut with no domestic or U.S. data on the horizon, traders say waiting for Alan Greenspan will be the order of the day.\nThe Federal Reserve chairman, who is due to deliver his Humphrey Hawkins testimony on the state of the economy at around 1800 GMT, will ensure that many players remain on the sidelines of debt markets in Europe this session.\nBy 0620 GMT, the September DTB Bund contract was two basis points higher at 102.72.  \nTechnical analysts said the September contract would face first resistance at 102.80, the high point reached during Monday's session. Beyond there, 102.98 and 103.00 will emerge as the next major hurdles.\nOn the support side, losses are expected to be limited to around 102.53 this session.\nAnalysts said the market would be expecting Greenspan to give a relatively tame view of the U.S. economy, but would be on the lookout for any sign of whether he continues to believe the current economic slowdown -- from the somewhat alarming pace of late last year -- is still temporary.  \n\"If he does not sound as worried about excessive economic growth and excessive asset price inflation as he did at the last Humphrey-Hawkins presentation in February, it would present a key change,\" said Karl Haeling, head of DMG Futures and Options in Frankfurt.\nIn February, Greenspan famously commented on \"irrational exuberance\" in financial markets, sending the U.S. stock market swiftly south. Since then U.S. shares have climbed again to new peaks, boosted by a positive economic outlook.\nFor Bunds, any sharp move in either direction will be determined U.S. Treasuries' reaction to Greenspan's words.  \nBut analysts said the market had a supportive base and was unlikely to take too much of a beating unless Greenspan were to be very hawkish.\nLater in the week, Bunds have domestic events to digest, with cost of living numbers from German states due from Wednesday and Thursday's final Bundesbank council meeting before the summer break.\nAnalysts said that although M3 money supply growth hit the Bundesbank's target corridor for the first time this year in June, the weakness of the mark and the overall economic picture would ensure that official interest rates are kept on hold.\n-- Kate Kelland, Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525\n","classes":[115,123],"classes_pad":null}

{"codes":["GCAT","GDIP","GODD"],"headline":"FEATURE - Santas sweat it out at World Summit.","text":"\nCOPENHAGEN, July 22 - It's not the first time that politics have overshadowed the World Santa Congress.\nThe last time the row was over where \"he\" really lives. This year delegates are scrapping about just who is entitled to be a Father Christmas and whether they should move Christmas to the summer.\nBefore they even arrived in Copenhagen for this week's 34th congress, the 95 delegates had been upstaged by a breakaway group who held a rival gathering in the provincial town of Naestved south of the Danish capital.\n\"You are not a Father Christmas just because you wear a big white beard and a red robe,\" said Ole Lundsgaard, head of the Danish Santas Guild.\nHe said the hottest item on the agenda would be how to ensure that it is only genuine Father Christmases who children come to know.\n\"There is a grave danger that children's illusions could be ruined if a mass of fake Santas suddenly turn up on the Father Christmas circuit,\" said congress chairman Kurt Flemming, who doubles as a circus clown when his yuletide duties allow.\nWHERE DOES HE REALLY LIVE\nThe Santa fraternity has been dogged in recent years over which Nordic country is Father Christmas's true home.\nGreenland laid claim to the title, but Finnish Lapland, Sweden, Norway and Iceland all put in rival bids until agreeing to differ and concentrate on how best to do the job.\nThis week's programme requires Santas from Australia, Britain, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Scandinavia and the United States to stage yule shows, sample powerful Danish Christmas Ale and eat their way through a heavy traditional Christmas dinner at the height of the Danish summer.\nThe star of the show is 86-year-old Dayton C.Fouts from Arizona who is celebrating 60 years as Father Christmas.\nFouts will join the others in a grand Father Christmas parade through the centre of Copenhagen and take part in the Santa of the Year contest.\nThe conference agenda includes such thorny issues as better rooftop parking for Santa's sleigh and stronger ropes for roof elves.\n\"Modern children want bigger and better gifts like computers and cycles. Santas want to grant their wishes but these presents are so bulky that more reindeer and bigger sleighs are needed,\" Flemming told Reuters.\n\"Today there are satellite dishes on almost every roof so it is totally impossible for Santas to park extra-large sleighs with six reindeer on rooftops on Christmas Eve.\n\"We are lobbying politicians to stop the authorities from slapping huge rooftop parking fees on Santas during their yuletide rounds,\" Flemming said.\nSAFETY FIRST\nThe drive for stronger ropes for the elves follows an accident last Christmas, when a rope lowering a Danish Santa snapped and he was badly hurt.\n\"The declining quality of Christmas rope is a major threat to Santas and roof elves,\" Flemming added.\n\"The Father Christmases will be discussing ways to get manufacturers to urgently improve rope quality.\"\nIn Denmark, where Christmas is celebrated on December 24, yule hobgoblins and elves -- play a prominent role along with Santa Claus -- known as 'yuleman' in Danish -- in seasonal festivities.\nBecause in most places Christmas is rarely ever truly white, the congress will also debate a proposal to move it to July 24 to make the festive season green.\n\"The vote on changing the date is going to be pretty close,\" Flemming said. \"But I am confident that a majority of Santas will insist on keeping Christmas in December.\"\n","classes":[90,93,103],"classes_pad":null}
{"codes":["GCAT","GPOL"],"headline":"FEATURE-Diehard Bonn still mourns losing govt to Berlin.","text":"\nSome of Bonn's embittered Berlin haters often gather near the banks of the Rhine to mourn the approaching loss of its most important industry -- the German government.\nSix years after parliament voted to move from its post-war home in the sleepy western town to the pulsating metropolis of Berlin, hundreds of diehard backers of a hopeless campaign to keep the government here refuse to concede defeat.\nIn rousing speeches at their regular rallies, they tell anyone who will listen that the move is pure madness and the decision should be annulled. They paint dark scenarios of a Nazi-like \"Berliner Republik\" and complain that the billions of deutschemarks which the move will cost could better be spent elsewhere.\n\"We will not give up,\" said Albert Brancato, a government translator, at one rally of about 300 people at Bonn's central market square marking the sixth anniversary of parliament's narrow 1991 vote in favour of Berlin.\n\"We will never lose if we never give up. Anyone who concedes defeat now because the government will soon begin its move doesn't understand the dangers involved. We will keep on fighting to save the values of the federal republic.\"\nMany Germans still view Berlin, however unfairly, with deep suspicion as the ominous Nazi capital and see Bonn as a quiet, dull but reassuring town where the country's confidence and world-standing were painstakingly rebuilt after World War Two.\nPOLLS SHOW MAJORITY OPPOSED TO BERLIN\nOpinion surveys regularly show a majority of Germans opposed to the move to Berlin.\n\"Bonn has been a model capital city for our federal system for the last 50 years,\" Hermann Gebertz, chairman of the Bonn Citizen's Alliance (BBB) told one rally. \"It is a terrible shame. These politicians are a disgrace.\"\nThe federal government and its cumbersome bureacracy may be loathed in many places in Germany, but it is a loved and cherished institution in Bonn, spreading billions of taxpayer marks (dollars) on an already-properous region.\nAs a government town immune to the whims of business cycles, Bonn was always innoculated from post-war economic downturns.\nThe government has sustained the quaint leafy town of 300,000 with tens of thousands of well-paying jobs and it has ensured the infrastructure is among the best and most efficient in Germany.\nBut about 18,500 of the highest paid of those jobs will move 600 km (400 miles) east to Berlin in 1999 and Bonn residents, already watching their property values decline, fret that the departure of the parliament, along with the embassies and lobbies, will leave behind an empty, broken-hearted town.\nThe federal government has tried to cushion the shocks of the move by leaving behind seven of its 16 ministries, including health and defence. It has also tried hard to lure international organisations so that Bonn will not become a ghost town.\nThe pro-Bonn rallies have declined in size over the years but not in intensity. Many of the 300 at the recent rally said it was a dark day for Germany when parliament voted after an emotional 11-hour debate 337 to 320 to move to Berlin.\nWORRIES ABOUT BERLIN\n\"It causes me anguish to think about Berlin as the capital again,\" said Frank Seemann, a 42-year-old bookshop owner at the rally. \"Germany hasn't had a good history with Berlin as the capital.\"\nSeemann said even though most Germans are opposed to the move he found it unfortunate that the only anti-Berlin rallies were still being held in Bonn.\n\"It makes it seem like we are just bad losers,\" he said.\nIn the early years after the 1991 vote, the Bonn rallies were enormous. Thousands packed the town square at weekly Thursday night rallies and for several years there were hopes that a newly elected parliament could overturn the 1991 decision.\nBerlin government leaders were constantly fearful that the decision to move could be overturned. It wasn't until 1994 when Chancellor Helmut Kohl appointed a can-do manager, Klaus Toepfer, to head the planning that those fears in Berlin began to fade.\nAt the same time, the Bonn rallies gradually began to dwindle in size as the move appeared to be unstoppable. But the diehard campaigners at the recent rally, the 142nd, insist they will never quit.\n\"My greatest fear is the threat of a Goetterdaemmerung (Armegeddon) in the Berlin Republic,\" said Heinz Schott, a Bonn professor in a speech to the rally just a few hundred metres (yards) from the river.\n\"I sense that many Berlin visionaries hope European integration will collapse so that they can finally celebrate in the former Reich capital city and revive Berlin as a national centre of power.\"\nIt is astonishing to hear such passionate words coming from a slightly built and balding professor in the heart of the tranquil Rhineside town.\n\"We don't need Berlin as a big brash capital city,\" Schott added. \"I get tired of hearing people like the mayor of Berlin raving about Berlin. Why not change the name to Germania. Isn't that what the Fuehrer wanted anyhow?\"\nCROSS SECTION OF VIEWS\nThere is an astonishing variety in the crowds of Bonn backers. And despite their tenacity, they are hardly from the fringes of society -- professors, lawyers, doctors, journalists, economists, bus drivers and government bureaucrats fill their ranks. The one common demonimator is their refusal to give up.\nBrancato said that 30 opinion polls since 1991 have show than a growing number of Germans are opposed to the move.\nMost oppose it because Germany is already struggling with the high costs of unification and they believe the estimated 20 billion marks ($12 billion) the move will cost could be better spent on measures to cut the 11 percent unemployment rate.\nOthers fear that Berlin will raise the ghosts of Germany's haunted past as a belligerent power in the middle of Europe and some are afraid the successful West German postwar system of decentralised government will be lost forever.\n\"There will be no continuity with the Bonn Republic,\" said Brancato. \"The government will move into the properties of three German dictatorships -- the Hohenzollerns, the Nazis and the East German communists. It is an appalling thought.\"\n","classes":[90,104],"classes_pad":null}

Tumarkin said the Uneximbank-MFK financial group, which recently announced a merger with investment bank Renaissance Capital, was also considering buying Rosneft. The Kommersant Daily newspaper also mentioned LUKoil, Russia's largest oil company, as interested.\nTumarkin said it was still unclear how the status of prize oil producer Purneftegaz would affect changes in Rosneft's privatisation. Rosneft has been in a legal tussle with SIDANKO for control of the key producer, but a court, in the latest ruling on the case earlier this month, awarded Purneftegaz back to SIDANKO.\nRosneft, once envisioned as Russia's national oil company, is one of the last vertically-integrated oil firms to be privatised.\nIt is prized for its status as the state's agent in production-sharing deals and for its stake in a planned oil export pipeline linking Kazakhstan's Tengiz field to Russia's Black Sea export outlet of Novorossiisk.\n","classes":[],"classes_pad":null}

Many ad agencies have a very hierarchical structure and exist only to benefit shareholders you never meet or owners with little direct involvement, so we created a corporate structure to match our ideals,\" Abraham told Reuters recently.\nSt Luke's says it is the only ad agency in the world to run as a cooperative. Everyone from the receptionist to the managing director gets an equal number of shares in the agency.\n\"The deal with Omnicom meant that they left an element of working capital in St Luke's. Omnicom will get a percentage of our income, which is a combination of client fees and profits. The percentage rises as our income rises. For our first million they get two per cent, from the next (million), four percent and so on over seven years,\" says finance director Neil Thompson.\nAll staff, along with getting shares, have the opportunity to vote on the size of their next pay rise. Although salaries differ, they differ less than in many other ad agencies. And performance reviews are done not only by bosses about subordinates, but by staff about their managers.\nEmployees vote on virtually every aspect of their working lives, from the colour the walls should be painted to the future direction of the agency.\n\"This summer the staff elected to slow down on the new business front and to concentrate on and enjoy what we already have. We are calling it the 'summer of love',\" said Abraham.\nBut he denied that St Luke's was some sort of \"hippy\" organisation. \"We are very serious and passionate about it,\" he said.\nThe agency now handles advertising business worth over 40 million pounds ($67.1 million).\nIt has attracted a string of clients including Midland Bank , Boots the Chemist Plc, United Distillers and furniture retailer Ikea.\n\"We are a 'top 30 agency' now and we will not pitch for accounts worth less than five million pounds,\" said Abraham.\nAs well as having an unusual management structure the agency also looks like no other.\nIt is housed in a converted toffee factory and has an artist in residence who has created wild sculptures around the building. Staff do not have their own desks or offices -- just lockers for their personal belongings and each person carries a mobile phone at all times. Computer terminals are scattered around the building and staff can choose to work in \"the womb\", a quiet room painted deep red, the \"chill out\" room, or even in the coffee room if they wish.\nThere is an in-house masseur available to all staff and the creative director's father, a former chef, prepares an Italian lunch every day.\nBut perhaps the most unusual aspect of the agency is that each client has its own themed room to act as a source of inspiration.\nSt Luke's works on the Boots Number 17 cosmetics account, a brand that is aimed at teenage girls, and the Boots room is decorated with pink walls, a bunk bed with pink duvets and posters of pop stars.\nEurostar, the Channel Tunnel rail company, has a room decorated to look like a train carriage complete with train seats, while the Clarks Shoes room contains a mini shoe shop.\nAbraham said the themed rooms were intended to create a focus for clients.\n\"Creativity and innovation are clearly recognised as points of competitive advantage, but the time that clients have to think creatively is minimal. We are opening their minds to new ways of thinking,\" he said.\nThe agency recognises that not all clients would be happy to work in this way.\n\"We meet a lot of prospective clients who are interested in what we are doing, but it doesn't mean that they will buy our services. We say to some clients we are not right for each other and they respect that. They would rather hear that than have us say that we are right just to win the business. The fit has to be right,\" he said.\nThe agency is now looking at other areas in which it can help its clients. Earlier this year it set up St Luke's 3, which is investigating opportunities in television and publishing. This ranges from advertiser-paid-for programming and sponsorship to ideas for television programmes that the creative team sells to independent television production companies.\n\"It is not just about helping clients with programming opportunities. It's also about helping the creative team get into an area which they are interested in,\" said Abraham.\nThe agency is also looking at international opportunities and has received a number of enquiries from advertising agencies in the U.S. and Scandinavia who are interested in running their businesses along similar lines to St Luke's.\n\"It's a long-term thing, but we are looking at how the model might translate and whether we franchise it. There are a lot of companies out there that are hungry for examples of how to run a fairly unusual, but successful business such as ours,\" said Abraham.\n-- London Advertising Newsdesk +44 171 542 4770 ($ = 0.596 British Pounds)\n","classes":[100],"classes_pad":null}

It is one of the country's biggest foreign exchange earners. Dom Scalpelli, WFP project officer, said a second minor crop in August will give a clearer idea of 1997 production.\nTrade has boomed in Mozambique since the end of a 16-year civil war in 1992, followed by elections in 1994. Peace and economic liberalisation increased business confidence.\nFarmers currently cultivate on average just over a hectare of land and Western aid officials, working in the countryside, say many are realising the impact of the new open market.\n\"People have never been encouraged to sell before, but they are now finding there is a market,\" one official said.\nThe WFP said, however, the increase in food production since last year was more due to favourable weather and political stability than to the impact of reforms in the sector.\nSome aid officials say the arrival of the first 13 South African farmers who have been granted rights on a former state farm in the northern province of Niassa is also a key factor.\n\"What the country needs is the little push that the South African farmers will give the sector,\" one official said.\nData from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development shows total area planted increased by six percent in 1996-97 to 3,627,000 hectares, but heavy rains had damaged about 130,000 hectares of food crops, including 45,000 hectares of maize along the rivers in some central and southern provinces.\nThe agriculture sector employs over 80 percent of the labour force with employment in non-farms sectors very limited.\nThe issue of land tenure being debated in parliament, which will appropriate land to individuals, companies and communities, is seen as necessary to build confidence among farmers working on state land.\n\"Mozambique is very close to food sufficiency, which will allow people to survive, but it won't make them develop,\" one aid official said.\n","classes":[],"classes_pad":null}

Fewer than 5,000 were sold in 1996\/97 (April-March).\n\"There is nothing wrong with Fiat's products. But both the Uno and the Cargo trucks have suffered as Fiat's partners did not have the wherewithal to promote and push its products as required,\" Rohit Rana, automobile analyst at SocGen Crosby said.\nHe said Fiat would have done much better if it had decided to come in on its own two years ago. Fiat's $1.0 billion investment plan involves several minority Indian partners in different projects.\nFiat is betting largely on its Palio world car to bring home the bacon in India, and to repeat the success it had in Brazil, where it has sold 300,000 Palios in the year since they were launched.\nThe Italian group recently received approval from the Indian government to set up a $558 million joint venture with PAL to make the Palio in India, in which it will own 74 percent equity.\nPaolo Cantarella, Fiat's chief executive officer, expects the venture to start production by late 1999, and make 100,000 cars at full capacity.\nBut it may well be too late by then. Rana estimates that the market for mid-size cars will be about 120,000 by 2000, while local production will total over 500,000.\n\"It's going to be a cut-throat market, and the later you launch your products, the tougher it is to make a mark,\" he said.\nFiat has to contend with the fact that some of its competitors are already in India in strength, and have their cars on the market.\nSouth Korea's Daewoo Corp, Ford Motor Co and General Motors Corp have already launched their cars in India, and Honda Motor Co, Mitsubishi Motor Co , and Hyundai Motor Co are all in the process of doing so.\nThe giant in the field is Maruti Udyog Ltd, an equal joint venture between Suzuki Motor Corp and the Indian government, which has 70 percent of the Indian car market.\n\"Fiat's products until now had not been cost competitive in India. The Cargo trucks are 10 to 12 percent more costly than the competition. And for about the same price, the Uno is an old car in comparison with the Maruti Zen,\" said Jardine Fleming's automobile analyst K.N. Srinivasan.\nHe said it was unlikely that Fiat would make a dent in this market in the short term.\n\"It will have to invest heavily in product promotion and distribution to make any headway when it launches its car in late 1999. It is still low on aggression when it comes to India as compared to companies like Daewoo,\" Srinivasan said.\n-- New Delhi newsroom +91 11 301 2024\n","classes":[],"classes_pad":null}
