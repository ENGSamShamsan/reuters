The cash flows are synthetically divided into regularly scheduled interest payments as well as principal payments which ammortize over the 20-year life of the security.\nThese ammortizing bonds currently offer a higher return than bullet bonds with the same average life of around 12.5 years, said Salomon's Adler.  \nOwners of the second security, known as zero-to-full coupon bonds, or ZTFs, get no payments for the first 20 years (similar to a generic zero coupon bond), and then receive the remaining 80 years of interest as well as the final principal payment of the 100-year bonds.\nAnalysts noted that ZTFs offer about three times the duration of a 100-year bond, meaning their prices are far more sensitive to changes in interest rates. Duration refers to the average maturity of a series of cash flows and is used to calculate exposure to interest-rate risk.  \nThe ZTFs also have around four times the convexity of a 100-year bond, meaning their price sensitivity increases dramatically as interest rates fall. This makes them an efficient hedge for mortgage portfolios which tend to underperform in a bullish interest rate environment, analysts said.\nZTF's have been especially popular with insurance companies and pension funds that look for assets to match long-term liabilites which do not mature for many years in the future.\nAnalysts noted other factors contributing to demand for stripped century bonds in addition to their unique cash-flow structures.\n\"This is a function, in part, of yield compression and the fact that everyone is looking for a different angle to pick up a bit extra,\" said Adler.\nAnother factor which has led to their development is that the raw material for strips, specifically century bonds, may be selling at fundamentally cheap levels, analysts said.\nAnalysts noted that, in some cases, the spread between 100-year bonds and 30-year bonds with comparable ratings have tightened from about 20 basis points to around 10 basis points in recent months as the investor base for these securities has grown.\nOne analyst said the spread is likely to tighten even further if demand for stripped products continues to increase.\nFinally, the creation of century bond strips may be indicative of an growing trend of chopping up cash flows from corporate bonds, Adler said.\n\"Whether it's 100-year bonds or anything else, you will see more trust structures that take corporates bought in the secondary market and carve up their cash flows,\" he added.\n(( -- U.S. Corporate Bond Unit, 212-859-1662 ))\n","classes":[115,123],"classes_pad":null}

He has a history of adroitly using costumes and makeup, Penelas said.\nInvestigators said he also may be wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses.\n\"Andrew Cunanan may not appear right now as he does in pictures. Apparently this gentleman changes appearances on a regular basis. He may be very difficult to identify.\"\nInvestigators were still concentrating the manhunt on the south Florida area but tips were flooding in from all over the United States, Penelas said.\nNewsweek magazine reported that a Brazilian woman told investigators she had photographs and videotape of Cunanan inside Versace's gated mansion a week ago, two days before the 50-year-old designer was killed after a visit to a newsstand.\nCNN reported that Brazilian police had concluded the people shown were not Versace and Cunanan though.\nBut Mayor Penelas, in the NBC interview, said: \"We are following up on literally thousands of tips that we've been receiving locally, individuals who believe they have sighted Andrew Cunanan somewhere in south Florida.\"\n\"Law enforcement officials are wading through those tips determining which in fact are credible and following up on those that warrant following up on,\" he said.\nCunanan is also being sought as a suspect in the murders of four other men in a cross-country killing spree before the Versace slaying. One of the four was reportedly a former gay lover of Cunanan's.\n","classes":[90,91,105],"classes_pad":null}

(MGIC). The triple-'A' issuer credit and claims-paying ability rating of subsidiary MGIC Mortgage Insurance Corp. (MMIC) also has been affirmed.\nMGIC's rating is based on its leading market position, which has led the company to produce a high-quality book of business and excellent capital adequacy. MGIC's strong name recognition and distribution system have resulted in its holding a leading market share of new premiums written since it restructured its operations in 1985.\nFor the year ended Dec. 31, 1996, the company's market share of new insurance written was 25.4%.\nMMIC is no longer writing new business, but its triple-'A' rating is affirmed based on a 100%-reinsurance arrangement with triple-'A' rated reinsurers.\nInsurance is ceded to MMIC by MGIC, and subsequently retroceded to the reinsurance syndicate. European Reinsurance Co. of Zurich (claims-paying ability rating of triple-'A') is the leader of this syndicate.\nRATING FACTORS:\n-- Superior claim incidence experience and loss ratios relative to peers. To date, MGIC has reported a loss ratio lower than the active industry for each book originated since 1988 and a lower claims incidence for each book since 1985.\nManagement has consistently demonstrated an ability to manage exposures geographically and across product categories that exhibit favorable loss development characteristics. For the year ending Dec. 31, 1996 the company reported an excellent 37.9% loss ratio.\n-- Excellent profitability. In 1996, MGIC reported, on a consolidated basis, pretax return on assets of 17.2% and return on equity of 24.3% relative to an industry average of 14.5% and 19.6%, respectively.\nThe company's performance has consistently been in the top quartile of the industry and reflects greater earnings stability than its peers.\n-- Capital adequacy, as indicated by risk to capital, has improved despite the company's reassumption of some of the old Wisconsin Mortgage Assurance Corp. book of insured risk. Excellent profitability and the additions to retained earnings lowered risk to capital to 18.4 to 1 at Dec. 31, 1996. MGIC's capital adequacy is excellent and survives the revised Standard & Poor's stress test, which models the company's insured risk through a 10-year regional recession.\n-- MGIC reserving practices are amongst the most conservative in the industry. At March 31, 1997 MGIC's case reserves stood at $473 million and represented the second-highest average reserve within the mortgage insurance industry at $18,410 per case.\nEXPECTATIONS:\nStandard & Poor's believes that recent performance is at an industry peak, although MGIC's earnings of $80.6 million for the six months ending June 30, 1997 indicate that a strong economy is continuing to drive demand for housing and improve the credit fundamentals of home ownership.\nStandard & Poor's believes that further growth of MGIC's risk in force will likely be funded from earnings, with some further strengthening of capital adequacy expected over the next few years.

The deepest divide in Washington is the Anacostia River.\nThe river, which runs into the much more famous Potomac on its way to Chesapeake Bay, divides Washington into the capital of the only remaining world superpower on one side and what is sometimes called the murder capital of the world on the other.\nAcross the river from the Washington of broad boulevards and monuments is Southeast Washington, a place some of its residents call a Third World country where a vicious cycle of poverty, drugs and violence belies the image of America as a shining city on a hill.\nIn the city where Martin Luther King Jr. once spoke of his dream of one nation no longer divided by race, the District of Columbia's two extremes are sadly separated.\n\"You've got a black city and a white city,\" African American building contractor and community activist Cardell Shelton told Reuters. \"When you look at every black community in this city it's a crime haven, decrepit, abused, misused and neglected. There's no economic development, no investment.\"\nTwo-thirds of Washington residents are African American, a demographic trend with origins in the days of slavery, when the city was a magnet for blacks escaping the plantations of the South. Washington remains largely segregated today.\n'SLAVERY GOT MARRIED TO RACIAL BIGOTRY'\n\"People were brought over here in chains 375 years ago and slavery got married to racial bigotry. It goes back all the way to then,\" Professor Leonard Steinhorn of Washington's American University, an author of books on race issues, said.\nDowntown Washington is sometimes referred to by tourists as the Paris of North America because of its stunning architecture and majestic monuments. Even the ethnic Adams Morgan district, home to immigrants from all over the world, thrives with nightlife, rivaling the historic Georgetown area as the trendiest in the city.\nBut the Southeast quadrant of Washington is where you go for a mugging at night, not a double latte.\nAt first glance, Southeast does not appear so bad. Its brick homes, many of them government-built projects, do not have the same kind of graffiti, piles of trash and broken windows of many inner-city slums. But Southeast residents routinely tick off a long list of problems with complex causes and evasive solutions.\n\"You're talking about a Third World nation,\" Nathan Price, a taxi driver who is leading a movement to remove Mayor Marion Barry from office, told Reuters. \"Something is wrong.\"\nWashington, a 68-square-mile (176 sq km) city of less than 600,000 people, had 397 murders last year, which ranks sixth in the United States behind megacities New York (986), Chicago (789), Los Angeles (709), Detroit (428) and Philadelphia (414), according to FBI crime statistics.\nSAFER THAN TOPEKA?\nThat was why it came as such a shock to Washingtonians when Barry told CNN recently that Washington was safer than Topeka, Kansas (population 120,000), which had 17 murders in 1996. Barry later attempted to clarify his comments, saying he was referring to the downtown and tourist areas of Washington, serving only to confirm Washington as a city of two faces.\nHe spoke before three young people were found murdered with multiple gunshot wounds to the head on July 7 in a grisly scene at a Starbucks coffee shop in fashionable Georgetown.\nBarry blames the district's unique status -- it has some of the attributes of a city and some of a state but is not really one or the other. \"It does not work,\" he said. \"The best manager in America, in the world, couldn't manage this government the way it's structured.\"\nEven out-of-towners know about the two Washingtons.\nTourist Bill Wallpe, a bank manager from Danville, Illinois, said he had been warned about it by a friend back home who is a former Washington police detective.\n\"When we were driving into town yesterday we came through some of these areas and got kind of lost,\" Wallpe told Reuters outside the White House. \"We got into some less than desirable parts of town.

Fred Shuttlesworth believes he knows why only one man was convicted for the infamous Ku Klux Klan bombing of a Birmingham church that killed four young black girls in 1963.\n\"It is well known,\" the 75-year-old civil rights leader said. \"There was collusion all along between the FBI, local law enforcement and the Klan.\"\nThe attack on the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church 34 years ago shocked most Americans and became a notorious symbol of the violence Southern whites were capable of in their resistance to the civil rights movement.\nKlan member Robert Chambliss was convicted of the bombing in 1977. He died in prison eight years later at the age of 81. But civil rights leaders say police have always known that Chambliss was not the only white man behind the attack.\n\"I hate to say it but I think all of these people would have been caught if these men had killed four little white girls,\" said Abraham Woods, who heads the Birmingham chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership conference, a civil rights group founded by Martin Luther King Jr.\n\"Unfortunately, black life has not been so valuable. There is still a lot of racism in the state of Alabama,\" he added.\nFor many blacks, news this month that the FBI had reopened the case for the fourth time since 1971 stirred painful memories of bombings, beatings, lynchings and other violence once perpetrated against them with the full knowledge of local white authorities.\nLOCAL POLICE DID NOTHING TO END KLAN ACTIVITIES\nShuttlesworth vividly remembers the day in 1956 when he realised local police not only knew members of the Ku Klux Klan but were resigned to do nothing to end their activities. A bomb had exploded at Shuttlesworth's home. At the time, he was pastor of the Bethel Baptist Church in Birmingham, which was a headquarters for civil rights campaigners.\nA young white policeman, hat in hand and crying, emerged from a crowd of journalists, city officials and neighbours that had gathered outside. \"I'm sorry, Reverend. I'd never have thought they'd go this far,\" the officer said, adding: \"If I were you, Reverend, I'd get out of town as fast as I can.\"\nOfficers from the same Birmingham police department later became a part of the history of the civil rights era when they confronted black demonstrators with firehoses and attack dogs in front of network television cameras.\nWhen civil rights leaders decided to move their headquarters from the Bethel church to the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, hate crimes followed. Just after 10 a.m. on Sunday, Sept. 15, 1963, while young girls were changing into their choir robes in a basement lavatory, a bomb went off in the church.\nThe explosion killed Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson and Cynthia Wesley, all 14, and 11-year-old Denise McNair. Two people died and 19 were injured in subsequent rioting.\nTwo surviving parents -- Chris McNair, the father of Denise, and Alpha Robertson, Carole's mother  -- declined to comment on the latest reopening of the case.\nPOLICE PROMISED OTHERS WOULD FACE TRIAL\nBut the Rev. John Cross, who was pastor of the Sixteenth Street church at the time of the bombing, remembers sitting in the courtroom balcony during the Chambliss trial as state police quietly pointed out to him several men in the audience who were leading suspects. They promised Cross \"there would be others\" to face trial. But nothing happened.\nChambliss went to trial after federal officials reopened the case in 1971. It was reopened again in 1980 and in 1988 without much success.\nThe FBI announced this month that it was looking into the crime once again after receiving new information. Attorney General Janet Reno said the federal government was determined to see that those responsible were brought to justice.\n\"I felt real excited when I heard it,\" Cross, now 72, said. \"I hope they'll make another arrest. I hope I'll be called to give some statement in court.\"\nLocal newspapers have identified three men as potential new suspects. One, who was questioned by investigators at his home in Texas, denies any connection with the Klan.\n\"I believe some arrests could have been made long ago,\" Woods complained. But successive investigations of the bombing have faced some formidable obstacles.\nFor instance, a 1980 Justice Department report said the late FBI director J. Edgar Hoover himself had once blocked the investigation despite assurances by FBI officers in Birmingham that they could make a case.\nBlack leaders also believe the decision to prosecute Chambliss irked enough white voters to cost former Alabama Attorney General Bill Baxley re-election.\nThis time around, some members of the Birmingham black community hope the climate has been changed by the Oklahoma City bombing, which brought the horrors of domestic terrorism into the nation's living rooms. But others remain sceptical.\n\"Interested, yes, but after 30 years ...\" said Roberta Lowe, whose three children were slightly injured by the 1963 church blast. \"I hope that there will be some closure and we will all learn to live in unity. If we can just learn to live together and be a unit, maybe that will prove something.\"\n","classes":[90,91,106,110],"classes_pad":null}

Some elements of the plan had already been adopted.\n\"We do not see growth going to zero. We think with decisive action soon, they can still grow this year,\" he said. But if the authorties did not act promptly, Thailand could be heading for \"a long period of slow growth\", he added.\nThailand was forced to devalue the baht currency this month after strong speculative pressure, and the decision sent shockwaves through currency markets across the region.\nThe Philippines devalued the peso and won $1.1 billion in emergency IMF funding to support future policies, Indonesia widened the rupiah's trading band against the dollar and pressure has risen on the free-floating Malaysian ringgit.\n\"The authorities have behaved rapidly and impressively,\" Fischer said.\nHe said the IMF was in contact with the authorities in Indonesia, where the rupiah touched record lows against the dollar on Monday before recovering slightly. \"We are quite confident that they know what they are doing and will deal with market pressures in the right way,\" he said.\nFischer said there was no reason for the currencies of regional economic powerhouses Hong Kong and Singapore to face speculative pressure.\n\"These are immensely strong currencies and not vulnerable in any way that we can see,\" he said. \"They have very good monetary authorities.\"\nThailand, unlike the Philippines, has not asked the IMF for help to resolve its problems, but Fischer highlighted currency flexibility, reforms in the financial sector and fiscal measures as things that would probably be needed.\nHe said the enforced currency float meant that the first issue was already being tackled and the authorities had made progress in reforming the financial sphere.\nA revised budget had been prepared before the currency crisis, but more action might be needed.\nFischer said there were similiarities between Thailand's problems and Mexico's financial crisis of 1995 but the problems were not on the same scale.\nGrowth had been strong longer in southeast Asian, which meant efforts to adjust policies to rein in problematic current account deficits were not likely to have the same recessionary effect.\nCapital flows were more robust than during the Mexico crisis and capital markets were not reacting in the same way.\n\"I think, as with everything, there are similarities -- a country which was regarded as suspect by the markets -- but there are critical differences,\" he said.\n\"We do not see the underlying adjustment in any of these countries being anything like that which had to be done in Mexico,\" Fischer said. \"There is a problem, but it is not on the same scale.\"\n","classes":[46,70,116,118,123],"classes_pad":null}

We have to do much more research on this,\" said Kenneth Olden, director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, which is hosting a three-day conference on estrogens in the environment in Arlington, Virginia.\nThese oestrogen-like substances, some scientists argue, have the potential to disrupt the endocrine system and may mimic or block regular hormonal activities. They are found in a broad range of products from pesticides and solvents to detergents.\nJohn Gibbons, science and technology adviser to U.S. President Bill Clinton, said the effect of estrogens was one of the Clinton administration's top five environmental health priorities. \"This is a global and not just a domestic challenge,\" he said.\nMost studies -- ranging from these estrogens' impact on breast and testicular cancer to lower sperm counts -- have focused on fish and wildlife but Olden said not enough was known about their effect on humans.\n\"Feminization of males, reproductive dysfunctions, behavioural changes and developmental problems are well studied in fish and wildlife,\" he said, adding that more research was needed on humans.\nFish and wildlife in the research studies were probably exposed to high levels of chemicals rather than the low levels that humans face in their daily lives.\n\"I think it is still hypothetical that low-level, man-made synthetic chemicals are having a health effect,\" he said.\nSome delegates said they believed even low-dose exposure of some estrogens could have a negative impact on humans.\nFrederick vom Saal, professor of reproductive biology and neurobiology at the University of Missouri-Columbia, said mice foetuses exposed to estrogenic chemicals were born with enlarged prostates, an early indicator of prostate disease.\nThe mice, he said were exposed to levels of chemicals that humans confront on a daily basis.\n\"There is no reason to believe that what we are seeing in animals you will not see in humans,\" he told Reuters. \"We should not continue to assume that humans are disconnected from the animal world.\"\nOther studies, he said, showed a strong decline in sperm counts in the United States and Western Europe, a rise in early puberty and a decrease in the ratio of male to female newborns which could be linked to estrogens.\nHowever, some scientists said the methodology used in several studies was not adequate, particularly in the decline of sperm counts.\n\"Has male reproductive health declined?

He walked into the Versace headquarters looking downcast.\nItalian ski star Alberto Tomba and the editor of influential style magazine Vogue Italia, Carla Sozzani, were among other luminaries who filed into the 19th century palazzo. Singer Sting and Italian opera star Luciano Pavarotti were also expected.\nOthers farther removed from Versace's glittering list of clients also arrived to pay their last respects. Around 100 workers from a Versace factory outside Milan travelled by bus to attend the mass.\nVersace was shot dead by a lone gunman on the steps of his mansion in Miami Beach, Florida, a week ago. Police have mounted a nationwide manhunt for Andrew Cunanan, a homosexual prostitute who is wanted in connection with four other killings in different states.\nVersace was cremated in Miami and his ashes were placed in a temporary tomb in a cemetery on the edge of Lake Como in a simple family ceremony last week.\nThe ashes, in an ornate gold casket, have been under close guard, but eyewitnesses on Monday said a police escort appeared to have removed the casket from the cemetery, which is close to Versace's secluded 18th century villa on the Como lakefront.\nA fashion industry source said she understood the designer's ashes would be at the Milan headquarters before the mass but this could not be confirmed and a Versace spokeswoman said any arrangements of that nature were private.\nTributes, meanwhile, continued to pour in from around the world for the designer, who vied with fellow Italian Giorgio Armani for the top spot in Italian chic.\n\"This is a great loss for the fashion world, Milan and all of his friends,\" said Rosita Missoni, wife of the Italian designer on her way into the Versace headquarters.\nVersace's brother, Santo, the business brain behind the Versace empire, and sister Donatella have vowed to carry on the multi-million dollar fashion house, which put the Versace name on couture, jeans, perfume and even bedlinen.\nAn insurance industry source told Reuters on Tuesday that the fashion empire had the life of its flamboyant founder insured for $21 million at Lloyd's of London.\n","classes":[90,91,98,102,105],"classes_pad":null}

Heavy flooding throughout the region has already claimed more than 100 lives in the Czech Republic and Poland.\nLater he was heading to steel town Eisenhuettenstadt. Built by communist East Germany in the 1950s as a model of industrial progress, and briefly named Stalinstadt after the Soviet dictator, it declined after German unification in 1990 but was rescued by huge cash injections from Bonn.\nKohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) are trailing badly in opinion polls in both cities, but his visit looked unlikely to convince east Germans who have become sceptical about the \"blooming landscapes\" he promised them in a 1990 unification pledge.\n\"The promises have always been there, but we still haven't seen any results,\" said Sylvia Eddert, 37, an unemployed sales assistant from Frankfurt-an-der-Oder.\nRetired railway worker Egon Butschkat, 61, from nearby Potsdam, was also sceptical about Kohl's ability to help them beat unemployment and economic stagnation.\n\"I don't really feel the government can do much to help us with our problems,\" he said. \"I think all this attention from politicians is just part of the election campaign.\"\nThe trip comes at a difficult period politically for the veteran chancellor. With just over a year until the next elections, his popularity is fading, especially in the former communist east.\nPollsters predict a hard fight for the CDU between now and the September 1998 polls. They argue that, as in the past two general elections, the contest will be won or lost in the east.\nIn Eisenhuettenstadt (Iron Works City), Kohl will visit a new steel mill at Eko Stahl GmbH, an east German company that would have folded without millions in subsidies from his government.\nEko, 60 percent owned by Belgian steel firm Cockerill Sambre, expects to become profitable in 1998. Cockerill has an option to buy the rest of it before 1999.\nCommentators called the trip a thinly-veiled attempt by Kohl, 67, to woo eastern voters on the eve of a month-long holiday in the Austrian Alps -- and to show off an exceptional east German success story before rolling television cameras.\n\"It is no accident Helmut Kohl finds himself in Brandenburg one more time before his holiday,\" said Berlin's Tagesspiegel newspaper in an editorial on Monday. Eisenhuettenstadt and Frankfurt are both in the state of Brandenburg.\n\"Without political backing and additional financial help from Bonn, Eko Stahl would have gone into liquidation a long time ago. The region is obliged to be grateful to the chancellor,\" the paper said.\nCommentators say that while Kohl made political capital by carrying off German unification, few believe he can fulfil his unification pledges to create a bouyant economy in the east, where unemployment currently averages 17 percent.\nSurveys show that a slim majority of Germans oppose Kohl's next pet project, the launch of Europe's single currency. Most opponents are east Germans who were so pleased to have the deutschemark, they are loath to swap it for an untested euro.\n","classes":[70,90,104],"classes_pad":null}

Because of this I did not give my permission for the sale,\" he said.\nRexrodt made it clear that he thought the 7,500 jobs at K&S were just as safe, regardless of whether or not it was sold.\nPossible monopolistic price hikes were one of the dangers to the public good, Rexrodt said. K&S already has a near monopoly in Germany with 80 percent of the market, and if the merger had gone ahead it would have dominated the market.\nBASF still wants to sell its 51-percent K&S stake, and it said it did not rule out any course of further action at the moment, either by selling shares on the bourse or by seeking another industrial partner.\nThe remaining 49 percent in K&S belongs to the east German development agency BvS.\nPCS chairman Charles Childers said that the group would review the purchase of K&S after the Rexrodt decision.\n\"While we are disappointed with the ruling, we must respect the decision of the Minister and we will now thoroughly review our position,\" Childers said.\nThe IGBE mining and energy union said its immediate concerns lay with employees at the K&S and related industries.\n\"With this decision, the opportunity to secure the future of the German potash industry has been missed. The 7,500 jobs have to be secured,\" the IGBE said in a statement.\nThe opposition Social Democrats (SPD) were disappointed.\n\"The future with a new shareholding partner is unclear. But we want to see support for one of the most important economic sectors in northern and eastern Hessen,\" SPD representatives Eberhard Fischer and Ilse Stiewitt said in a statement.\nBASF said that the merger as planned would have ensured the continued employment of K&S's 7,500 employees, as well as employment in related areas, and \"would have greatly improved Kali & Salz's competitiveness in the future.\"\nBASF on its own had only limited chances of turning the company into a global competitor because of overcapacity in the potash fertiliser market.\nOriginally the German cartel office blocked the sale, citing possible dominance of the German potash market.\nPotash and BASF could have applied to Berlin courts to have the cartel watchdog decision overturned,but instead it opted to ask Rexrodt, who can overturn a cartel office decision if there are overrriding implications for the economy or for employment.\n\"Clearly these paragraphs in German competition law are based on ensuring the public interest is served. But the real struggle for existence is being fought on a transparent and hard-fought global market,\" Wolf said.\nRalf Bethke, management board chairman of K&S, said: \"This is very bad news for the company. Now we have to reassure our employees and their representatives, who supported the planned merger, that we will do our best to continue our operations.\"\n-- Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525\n","classes":[25,26,43,44,62,70,90,100],"classes_pad":null}

He added that he had discussed the issue with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright by telephone on Monday and European Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan.\nKinkel was speaking on the sidelines of a regular meeting of EU foreign ministers.\nNothing seemed to be able to stop the Commission, however, which received twice the unanimous support of national antitrust experts for its plan to block the merger on the grounds it would damage fair competition in the 15-nation bloc.\nEuropean Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert, which opposed the deal from the start, needs only a majority of the 20-member Commission to win the vote on Wednesday.\nSome European antitrust lawyers have speculated that the Commission may agree on a cautious statement saying that the merger cannot be allowed in its present form, leaving the door open for Boeing to refile a modified agreement at a later stage.\nThe climate on the two sides of the Atlantic has become very confrontational over the merger, with the U.S. Congress mounting a political and trade battle and French President Jacques Chirac claiming the merger is \"extremely dangerous\".\nBut a report in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday hinted Boeing and McDonnell Douglas would not openly challenge an EU ban, saying they may delay a shareholders meeting which was expected to give the merger the final go-ahead on Friday. No one was available for comment at the two companies.\nBoeing and the Commission have not held any substantive talks since last week, an EU source said on Tuesday, despite the presence in Brussels since Friday of Boeing's executive vice-president Richard Albrecht .\nAsked if Boeing still had a chance to win a reprieve, the EU source said, \"In 24 hours you can do a lot of things, but you can't disregard legal procedures.\"\nHe said it would be difficult for Van Miert to reverse his plan to ban the merger before Wednesday since he would have to draft a new text and send it to senior Commission officials and the EU national antitrust experts for review.\nThe Commission believes the deal would strengthen Boeing's already dominant position in the commercial sector, a conclusion rejected by the manufacturer, which argues McDonnell Douglas no longer constitutes a serious competitor.\nMcDonnell Douglas's strength in the military sector, also causes the Commission to fear that Boeing would benefit from defence funds to subsidise its commercial programmes.\nBut the most contentious point remains the exclusive supply contracts signed with large U.S. airlines AMR Corp's American Aitlines, Continental Airlines and Delta Air Lines .\nThe source said there had been some progress during talks between the two sides, but that \"As long as there is not an agreement on everything, there is no agreement at all.\"\nThe Commission's determination to block the merger has triggered a barrage of sharp criticism on the other side of the Atlantic and President Bill Clinton warned the United States might go to the World Trade Organisaton or impose sanctions if this happened.\nThe EU executive has the power to block the deal if it finds it would harm fair competition in the 15-nation bloc. Were Boeing to go ahead with the merger regardless, it could impose fines up to 10 percent of the companies' turnover.\n","classes":[25,26,40,44,64,70,80,87,88,90],"classes_pad":null}

He added that he had discussed the issue with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright by telephone on Monday and European Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan.\nKinkel was speaking on the sidelines of a regular meeting of EU foreign ministers.\nNothing seemed to be able to stop the Commission, however, which received twice the unanimous support of national antitrust experts for its plan to block the merger on the grounds it would damage fair competition in the 15-nation bloc.\nEuropean Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert, which opposed the deal from the start, needs only a majority of the 20-member Commission to win the vote on Wednesday.\nSome European antitrust lawyers have speculated that the Commission may agree on a cautious statement saying that the merger cannot be allowed in its present form, leaving the door open for Boeing to refile a modified agreement at a later stage.\nThe climate on the two sides of the Atlantic has become very confrontational over the merger, with the U.S. Congress mounting a political and trade battle and French President Jacques Chirac claiming the merger is \"extremely dangerous\".\nBut a report in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday hinted Boeing and McDonnell Douglas would not openly challenge an EU ban, saying they may delay a shareholders meeting which was expected to give the merger the final go-ahead on Friday. No one was available for comment at the two companies.\nBoeing and the Commission have not held any substantive talks since last week, an EU source said on Tuesday, despite the presence in Brussels since Friday of Boeing's executive vice-president Richard Albrecht.\nAsked if Boeing still had a chance to win a reprieve, the EU source said, \"In 24 hours you can do a lot of things, but you can't disregard legal procedures.\"\nHe said it would be difficult for Van Miert to reverse his plan to ban the merger before Wednesday since he would have to draft a new text and send it to senior Commission officials and the EU national antitrust experts for review.\nThe Commission believes the deal would strengthen Boeing's already dominant position in the commercial sector, a conclusion rejected by the manufacturer, which argues McDonnell Douglas no longer constitutes a serious competitor.\nMcDonnell Douglas's strength in the military sector, also causes the Commission to fear that Boeing would benefit from defence funds to subsidise its commercial programmes.\nBut the most contentious point remains the exclusive supply contracts signed with large U.S. airlines AMR Corp's American Aitlines, Continental Airlines and Delta Air Lines.\nThe source said there had been some progress during talks between the two sides, but that \"As long as there is not an agreement on everything, there is no agreement at all.\"\nThe Commission's determination to block the merger has triggered a barrage of sharp criticism on the other side of the Atlantic and President Bill Clinton warned the United States might go to the World Trade Organisaton or impose sanctions if this happened.\nThe EU executive has the power to block the deal if it finds it would harm fair competition in the 15-nation bloc. Were Boeing to go ahead with the merger regardless, it could impose fines up to 10 percent of the companies' turnover.\n","classes":[13,25,26,40,44,80,82,87,90],"classes_pad":null}

About 600,000 rental cars are now touring in Europe, BBL said.\nTourism will be the main source for growth but new formulas, such as using replacement cars when owners' cars are in the garage, are also becoming more and more widespread in Europe, it said.\nBBL said the main market segment and fastest grower remained the airport rental business, noting this accounted for 77 percent of turnover of Hertz and 45 percent of all U.S. rental companies combined.\nThe European car rental market, which accounts for between six and seven percent of the European car production, is dominated by five companies -- Hertz, Avis Europe, Europcar, Budget and Eurodollar.\nAvis is market leader in Europe with 16.5 percent, with Hertz a close second on 15.6 percent. BBL noted Avis bought about 140,000 cars a year.\nBBL said the European market was more fragmented than the U.S. one due to the high number of local players, which represented 39.9 percent against 7.9 percent in the U.S.\nThe Mediterranean is the main pole of attraction for tourists in Europe, with 70 percent of all car rentals, it said.\nGermany is the main rental market in Europe with 28.6 percent, followed by Britain at 17.7 percent.

This will link Britain to the European continent from October 1, 1998 and further develop the natural gas trade in both directions. Via the Belgian network in the connection, Russian natural gas will reach the substantial British market.\nDepaemelaere underlined the importance of a strategic link between Britain and Belgium to provide gas in a growing European market.\nRussian Prime Minister Viktor Tchernomyrdine, also well aware of Belgium's importance in this equation, stopped-off at Bruges and Zeebruges and showed a particular interest in Distrigaz's works. Tchernomyrdine, the ex-president of Russia's Gazprom which is responsible for production of Russian gas and a 10-percent stakeholder in the under-sea link, stressed the importance of gas-related activities in Belgium.

Soft red winter is valued near $135 for October compared with French wheat in the mid-$140s. The gap is wider for August where soft red is worth $128.\nThe European Commission's subsidy stance will be crucial but cannot yet be easily evaluated since last week's first auction of the season was dominated by refunds of less than one Ecu to cover outstanding sales to Iraq and Cuba.\nBut exporters said they would remind the Commission that Egypt had returned to the European market in the past season after previously having bought mostly U.S. wheat since the Gulf War.\nCairo bought 1.53 million tonnes in the first 10 months of 1996\/97 (July\/June) against just 100,000 tonnes in the whole of 1995\/96.

Both are accused of complicity in the killings.\nThe verdict is not expected before 4 p.m. (1400 GMT).\nMany relatives of the victims consider the trial a second chance for Italy to put the record straight after a first war crimes trial last year ended in uproar and embarrassment.\n\"This is another shot to get it right because the whole world came down on them last time,\" said Robert Katz, a U.S. historian of the Nazi period.\nThe Ardeatine Caves massacre has revived painful memories of the Nazi occupation. SS officers rounded up 335 men and boys, including 75 Jews, and took them to the caves, south of Rome, where they shot them in reprisal for a partisan attack.\nPriebke was the sole defendant in an often chaotic first trial that ended on August 1 last year. A military court, split 2-1 (corrects split and number of judges on panel from \"2-3\" to \"2-1\"), decided that the 83-year-old German was guilty but should not be punished because of a statute of limitations -- in other words, too much time had elapsed since the original crime.\nProtesters laid siege to the courtroom, where Priebke was arrested hours later. The verdict was later quashed on appeal.\n\"What the judges are deciding now is how politically to present it (the verdict),\" said Shimon Samuels, Director of International Affairs for the Los Angeles based Simon Wiesenthal Center that specialises in tracking ex-Nazis.\n\"They don't want to repeat what happened last year...What it looks like it's going to be is a condemnation but with clemency due to age,\" he told Reuters.\nPriebke turns 84 next week and Hass is a year older. Both men have been held under house arrest during the trial.\nThe prosecution has demanded a life sentence for Priebke and 24 years for Hass, saying Priebke's crimes were aggravated by cruelty, brutality and premeditation, while Hass could claim mitigating circumstances.\nLawyers for the victims' families want five life sentences for each of the two Germans. The defence wants them set free.\nPriebke was extradited in November 1995 from Argentina, where he lived openly for nearly half a century.\nHass was a reluctant prosecution witness in Priebke's first trial, but broke his pelvis trying to flee to avoid giving evidence and eventually testified from his hospital bed.\nHe was arrested after admitting that he also took part in the massacre. Both men have admitted they each shot two victims and Priebke has said he also ticked names off a list.\nBut both have said they were obeying orders, and would have been shot themselves had they refused.\nSpizzichino said she had felt \"much hope\" during the trial, which began in April. \"But today I'm prepared for the worst.\"\n\"I hope that this time Italy's moral health will prevail,\" said Rosina Stame, who lost her husband at the caves. \"The whole world is watching. Either way, my bitterness remains.\"\nKatz summed up the feelings of many of the victims' families, gathered at the courtroom to await the verdict.\n\"I can't see how they could not find (Priebke) guilty to the fullest extent,\" he said. \"But then again, I thought so last time as well.\"\n","classes":[90,91,110],"classes_pad":null}

The company did not give a forecast for the full year.\nBelow is a selection of analysts' comments:\nPETER WORTEL, DELTA LLOYD BANK:\n\"There's nothing that wasn't expected. They had some good artists in the first half and some albums, notably U2's, sold really well. On the film side, it's a bit disappointing. It's loss-making and will remain so for the time being. In the second half there are some good names, but were knew about them already. The prospects are good, but not spectacular.\"  \nTHIJS BERKELDER, HSBC VAN MEER JAMES CAPEL\n\"The results were right on target for most analysts. Nothing was surprisingly higher or lower. Music had maybe somewhat lower profit and film had a slightly lower loss (than expected). For the second half, you have to look at the new releases and they have quite a number and they can benefit from new films. 'Bean' for instance is already introduced and looks promising. Looking at the release schedule, you must remain relatively positive for the second half.\"  \nANDRE MOONS, ING BARINGS\n\"My first reaction is that again it's a stable result, which particularly in a stock market climate like this...is not so inspiring. When you look at the results breakdown, film is a lot lower -- as expected -- and while music did a lot better after correction for currencies and so forth it's not that impressive. Polygram gave no firm forecasts for 1997, although their release schedule for the second half contains some strong acts like Boyz II Men, Shania Twain...and Jackie Cheung. Even so, that's rather an unsteady base on which to project major earnings growth. Film is expected to perform better (in the second half).\nWe have the stock on a hold recommendation and based on currency strength we expect to maintain this.\"\n-- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040\n","classes":[15,16,44],"classes_pad":null}

Anything under 560 million marks would be a disappointment.\nWodniok predicted six-month sales would reach 2.4 billion marks, compared with 1.594 billion in the year-ago period.\n\"I'm looking for a 45 to 50 percent increase in pretax profit in light of their prognosis and the favourable currency situation,\" he told Reuters.\nIn the first quarter, currency effects accounted for about 55 million marks, or eight percentage points of its 49 percent rise in sales to 1.032 billion marks.\nThe company draws about a third of its sales from the U.S. market, where the dollar stands at an eight-year high of 1.80 marks, even higher than the 1.67 rate at the end of the first quarter.\nIts shares were trading at 414.50 marks at 1140 GMT, up 9.30, with the blue-chip DAX index showing a gain of around three percent to around 4,230. They have risen 19 percent in the last 30 days as Daimler-Benz AG, Volkswagen AG and Bayer AG signed deals to use SAP's R\/3 software in global computer projects.\nR\/3 allows large companies to control manufacturing, purchasing, personnel and financial data from computers spread throughout their organisations.\nThe strength of the dollar is likely to enable SAP to exceed its full-year estimates of a sales rise of 30 percent and a profit increase of a few percentage points more, Wodniok said.\n\"We are forecasting more than 30 percent sales growth and clearly more than 30 percent profit growth because of the currency,\" he said.\nHackenberg predicted 1997 earnings per share of eight marks, up 46 percent from last year's 5.48 marks.\nHowever, SAP shares could still be in for a bumpy if upward ride in the second half, Wodniok said.\nThird-quarter results are likely to show large gains compared to a year ago, when SAP reported an unexpected slowdown in sales and profit growth that led to a sharp drop in its share price, he said.\nIn this year's fourth quarter, growth rates could show much slower growth against the year ago period, when SAP rebounded and returned to dramatic growth rates.\n\"That is the real question,\" Wodniok said. \"What will the second half be like?\" -- neal.boudette@reuters.com (Bonn =49-228 26097150)\n","classes":[15,18,44],"classes_pad":null}

But only a handful had volunteered to go, she added.\nIn both swoops, she told the news briefing, UNHCR staff in the area reported that families had been split up.\n\"In both cases, the refugees were loaded onto buses before UNHCR field staff could get to them. In both cases, UNHCR was not able to do the usual checks to ensure people were going back voluntarily, and we were not allowed to do medical checks.\n\"We have sent a second letter of protest to the Bangladesh authorities. We insist that this forced repatriation should stop,\" the spokeswoman added.\nBangladesh argues the refugees, and others the UNHCR reports are still flocking across the border, are economic migrants who put an unbearable burden on the poverty-ridden country.\nThe UNHCR says while many of the refugees -- the remnants of some 250,000 Rohingas who fled Burma in the early 1990s -- admit they were seeking a better life, others insisted they were escaping political persecution and forced labour.\nBangladeshi officials say more than 15,000 Rohingyas have arrived in Bangladesh over the last three months in a new influx, triggered by what the refugees said were continuing military persecution and recent rise in food prices.\nO'Toole said many new arrivals from Burma who had been contacted by UNHCR staff had come from deeper inside Burma than the earlier refugees. \"They speak of their land being confiscated and of forced labour,\" she added.\n","classes":[90,93,110],"classes_pad":null}

Heavy flooding throughout the region has already claimed scores of lives in the Czech Republic and Poland.\nLater he was heading to steel town Eisenhuettenstadt. Built by communist East Germany in the 1950s as a model of industrial progress, and briefly named Stalinstadt after the Soviet dictator, it declined after German unification in 1990 but was rescued by huge cash injections from Bonn.\nKohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) are trailing badly in opinion polls in both cities, as well as in Berlin.\nThe trip comes at a difficult period politically for the veteran chancellor. With just over a year until the next elections, his popularity is fading, especially in the former communist east.\nPollsters predict a hard fight for the CDU between now and the September 1998 polls. They believe that, as in the past two national elections, the contest will be won or lost in the east.\nIn Eisenhuettenstadt (Iron Works City), Kohl will visit a new steel mill at Eko Stahl GmbH, an east German company that would have folded without millions in subsidies from his government.\nEko, 60 percent owned by Belgian steel firm Cockerill Sambre, expects to become profitable in 1998. Cockerill has an option to buy the rest of it before 1999.\nCommentators called the trip a thinly-veiled attempt by Kohl, 67, to woo eastern voters on the eve of a month-long holiday in the Austrian Alps -- and to show off an exceptional east German success story before rolling television cameras.\n\"It is no accident Helmut Kohl finds himself in Brandenburg one more time before his holiday,\" said Berlin's Tagesspiegel newspaper in an editorial on Monday. Eisenhuettenstadt and Frankfurt-on-the-Oder are both in the state of Brandenburg.\n\"Without political backing and additional financial help from Bonn, Eko Stahl would have gone into liquidation a long time ago. The region is obliged to be grateful to the chancellor,\" the paper said.\nCommentators say that while Kohl made political capital by carrying off German unification, few believe he can fulfil his 1990 pledge to create \"blossoming landscapes\" in the east, where unemployment averages 17 percent.\nSurveys show that a slim majority of Germans oppose Kohl's next pet project, the launch of Europe's single currency, Most opponents are east Germans who were so pleased to have the deutschemark, they are loath to swap it for an untested euro.\nKohl has also personally backed cutting the solidarity tax surcharge levied to finance the reconstruction of east Germany -- a move that has bred resentment in east Germany but been applauded by west Germans who shoulder most of the burden.\n","classes":[45,55,70,90,94,104],"classes_pad":null}

DSM to boost Euro plastics production.","text":"\nDutch chemicals group DSM on Tuesday unveiled a billion-guilder acquisition to boost its position as a leading European polyolefins producer in the new millennium.\nThe acquisition and expansion of Vestolen GmbH's polyolefin activities at Gelsenkirchen, Germany, will involve an investment of one billion guilders ($492.2 million) spread over several years, DSM said.\nIt declined to disclose the purchase price, to be financed from existing cash flow, and estimated by some industry sources at around $200 million.\nUnder the deal, DSM -- currently Europe's fifth largest polyolefins producer -- will take over the polyolefin activities of Vestolen, a unit of German oil refiner Veba Oel AG.\nVestolen's Gelsenkirchen site has polyethylene production capacity of 150,000 tonnes per annum(TPA) and 200,000 TPA polypropylene.\nOver the coming years DSM plans to step up production at the site by building a 300,000 TPA linear low-density polyethylene gas-phase plant and a 250,000 TPA polypropylene gas phase plant.\n\"After completing the projects in 2001, DSM will be one of the leading producers of polyethylene and polypropylene in Europe, with the lowest possible costs, a broad polyolefins portfolio and world-scale technological capabilities,\" DSM said.\nChairman Simon de Bree told a telephone news conference that after expansion, synergies between the Geleen and Gelsenkirchen sites would generate cost savings of some 100 million guilders a year.\n\"Our leading cost position has been secured for the future,\" De Bree said.\nHe said the deal would also secure DSM's existing strong position as supplier of polyethylene well into the first decade of the next century.\nBy the millennium, DSM's total polyolefins capacity will exceed 2.5 million tonnes a year, he said.\nCurrent annual polyolefin capacity at DSM's Geleen plant is 1.52 million.\nThe agreement is aimed at meeting the strong growth in global demand for polyethylene, used in packaging articles such as bottles, bags and films, and polypropylene, used in packaging, textile fibres and plastic car parts.\nWestern European polyethylene consumption is set to jump by some 3.5 million TPA to 13.5 million by 2010, while polypropylene use will jump to nine million TPA from 5.4 million, DSM says.\nWorldwide consumption is seen growing even more.\nAfter the expansion, DSM will command around 12 percent of both European markets, said Henk van Dalen, head of DSM's polyethylenes business group.\n\"This European market growth does not take into account the very large growth potential of eastern Europe,\" he added.\nDe Bree said that around 90-95 percent of polyolefin production at the sites was destined for European consumption.\nHe said DSM's Geleen site, one of the world's largest integrated production complexes for polyethylene and polypropylene, offered too little scope for expansion.\n\"(The acquisition) is a real opportunity as in Geleen there is not sufficient olefins capacity, specifically in polypropylene,\" he said.\nConsequently DSM was opting for a \"Buy and Build\" approach.\n\"By acquiring an existing site which offers scope for expansion and guarantees a secure supply of ethylene and propylene, DSM can copy its successful 'Geleen model' in polyolefins,\" the company said.\nThese feedstocks will be supplied to Gelsenkirchen by Veba Oel from the production plants of Ruhr Oel, its 50-50 joint venture with Petroleos de Venezuela, under a long-term contract stretching to 2015.\nDe Bree stressed the plastics investment did not come at the expense of further expansion in fine chemicals and other downstream activities.\n\"The level of investment is about one-fifth of what we will spend over that period (to 2002),\" he noted.\nDSM said in February it expected to invest around one billion guilders over 1997, excluding acquisitions.\nOn the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, DSM shares opened 5.50 guilders higher on the news at 230.00, touching 233 guilders before settling at 228.00 at midsession in a buoyant market.\nAnalysts were also broadly upbeat on the news, although some said the move had taken them a little by surprise.\n\"We had been expecting an expansion in fine chemicals, and now it's plastics,\" said Patrick Rutten, chemicals analyst with Van Lanschot Bankiers.\n\"Positive is the fact that this will make DSM European market leader by 2001 -- there is sure to be concentration in the sector but DSM has stolen a march on the competition.\"\nHe said that over the longer term, the deal would hike profits per share by an average 4-6 guilders a year over the full industry cycle.\nAsked to comment, De Bree said \"I do not see any reason to disagree with that estimate\", agreeing it was a realistic ball-park figure.\nDSM posted 1996 net profits of 720 million guilders or 23.83 guilders per share, down from a year-earlier 1.07 billion or 29.60 per share.\n","classes":[25,27,32,44],"classes_pad":null}

There is still no danger for consumer prices either,\" said David Brickman, economist at Yamaichi International in London.\nAll 10 economists polled by Reuters expected no change in headline interest rates at Thursday's meeting -- or for the rest of 1997 -- with discount and Lombard rates remaining at 2.5 and 4.5 percent, respectively, until the turn of the year.\nSome analysts said the monetary policy status quo would remain in place well beyond that.\n\"There is a very good chance that the Bundesbank will keep rates on hold even through 1998,\" said Ros Lifton, economist at HSBC Markets in London.\n\"The fundamentals signal that there is no need for a change in policy ... The correction of the mark provides a sufficient boost for the economic sectors in Germany and will keep the recovery process on track,\" she added.\nWith no change expected for quite some time in the central bank's key interest rates, greater attention will be focused on the repo, or repurchase rate.\nSome market participants have been speculating recently that the sharp depreciation in the mark might prompt the central bank to move to a variable rate rather than the fixed 3.0 percent which has been in place since August last year.\nBut analysts said that this move, too, was unlikely to come for at least another few months.\nHans-Jorg Naumer, economist at Societe Generale in Frankfurt, said a repo move could come in September.\n\"The repo could see a move in September this year,\" he said. \"The Bundesbank could switch to a variable tender and raise the repo rate to 3.125 percent.\"\nApart from credit conditions, the other main talking point of this week's meeting -- the last before the council takes a summer break -- will be a review of the M3 money supply indicator which the central bank uses as an early warning signal oninflation.\nCentral bank council member Ernst Welteke said on Monday that with M3 money supply growth finally within the bank's 3.5 to 6.5 percent target corridor, the review of the indicator would be an easier task.\nAnnualised M3 money supply growth slowed to 6.4 percent in June from 7.0 percent in May, reaching the target zone for the first time this year.\n\"It is comforting to see that M3 has reached the target corridor. It means that our discussion about M3 will be easier,\" he told reporters.\nAnalysts said Welteke's words, coupled with a string of comments from other key Bundesbank officials in recent months defending M3 as a monetary policy aid, meant that any change in the bank's use of the indicator, or in its 3.5 to 6.5 percent 1997 target zone, was highly unlikely.\n-- Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 7\n","classes":[46,47,70,116,123],"classes_pad":null}

A spokewoman for Diana's office in London declined confirmation but told Reuters: \"The princess is aware of the arrangements for the memorial service. If she does attend, it will be in a private capacity.\"\nThe princess, among the world's most photgraphed women, was snapped in Versace designs and often spoke of her friendship for the designer, who was shot dead outside his mansion in Miami Beach, Florida, last week.\nVersace, who was 50 when he died, had returned the compliment by naming a handbag -- the Lady Di -- after her.\nDuring his flourishing career, he dressed the rich and famous from U.S. singer Madonna to Princess Caroline of Monaco in his raunchy signature style.\nFashion industry sources and newspapers said there would be a chance for friends to pay their respects privately at the Versace headquarters in Milan's exclusive Via Montenapoleone design district in the hours before the mass.\nPolice stood guard and barriers were up outside the entrance to the palazzo but the street was quiet.\nVersace was cremated in Miami and his ashes were placed in a temporary tomb in a cemetery on the edge of Lake Como in a simple family ceremony last week.\nThe ashes, in an ornate gold casket, have been placed under close guard. The family is reported to fear vandalism after their mother's tomb in southern Italy was tampered with 10 years ago.\nBut eyewitnesses on Monday said a police escort appeared to have removed the casket from the cemetery, which is close to Versace's secluded 18th century villa on the Como lakefront.\nA fashion industry source said she understood the designer's ashes would be at the Milan headquarters before the mass but this could not be confirmed and a Versace spokeswoman said any arrangements of that nature were private.\nTributes, meanwhile, continued to pour in from around the world for the designer, who vied with fellow Italian Giorgio Armani for the top spot in Italian chic.\nVersace's brother, Santo, the business brain behind the Versace empire, and his sister, Donatella, a talented designer in her own right, have vowed to carry on where their brother left off.\nThe Italian press quoted designer Karl Lagerfeld as saying he was ready to design for the fashion house, which Versace built into a multi-million dollar empire after launching his first own-name collection at the age of 31.\nBut a spokeswoman for Lagerfeld in Paris denied the reports.\nBritish supermodel Campbell, a close friend of the dead designer, was expected to fly in from South Africa for Tuesday's cathedral service.\nCampbell, who always sashayed along the Milan catwalk for Versace's ready-to-wear collections, broke down in tears on television when talking about the designer.\n\"I'm still in shock, I still can't believe what's happened,\" she said.\n","classes":[90,91,98,105],"classes_pad":null}

Most of the policies cover flood damage.\n\"We expect considerable costs. But the full damage can only be appraised when the water level has fallen back,\" a spokesman for the Munich-based company said in response to enquiries.\nHe added that the damage caused by flooding around the River Oder, which marks the German-Polish border, had already affected hundreds of homes on the German side.\n\"But we shall also have to see if there will be a second wave which could indeed be greater than the first. We hope this won't happen,\" the spokesman said.\nWhile the old east German policies generally offer flood damage protection as standard, new policies signed since 1990 only include this as an extra.\nThe floods swept through central Europe last week claiming scores of lives. The fact that their arrival in Germany was widely forecast means however that the extent of individual damage claims should be limited.\nAllianz had said earlier in a statement that motor insurance policies would only cover damage to vehicles if it was clear that a customer had not acted negligently by, for example, parking in a possible flood zone.\nEqually, it is hoping that householders have acted to move any valuables out of cellars and ground floors up to higher storeys while the flood danger remains.\nOn Monday, reinsurance group Munich Re said it expected to face claims of between 20-60 million marks as a result of the floods.\n--Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525\n","classes":[15,18,44,90,94],"classes_pad":null}

A child died in Bombay in April 1996, when he jumped off a 10-storey building trying to reach a beverage truck at the bottom of the structure.\n\"Following the child's death, all subsequent airing of the commercial was preceded by a written and spoken warning not to imitate what was shown in the film,\" Jimmy Mogal, senior manager, external and corporate affairs, Coca-Cola India, told Reuters.\nHe said the commercial had been airing on both satellite and terrestrial channels since March 1996, and played before programmes with high audience ratings.\nMogal said the withdrawn commercial was the second to feature bungee jumping. He added the target audience for all of Coca-Cola India's advertising was from the early teens to the late twenties.\n-- Sanjit Singh, New Delhi newsroom +91 11 301 2024\n","classes":[37,44],"classes_pad":null}

They had some good artists in the first half and some albums, notably U2's, sold really well. On the film side, it's a bit disappointing. It's loss-making and will remain so for the time being. In the second half there are some good names, but were knew about them already. The prospects are good, but not spectacular.\"  \nTHIJS BERKELDER, HSBC VAN MEER JAMES CAPEL\n\"The results were right on target for most analysts. Nothing was surprisingly higher or lower. Music had maybe somewhat lower profit and film had a slightly lower loss (than expected). For the second half, you have to look at the new releases and they have quite a number and they can benefit from new films. 'Bean' for instance is already introduced and looks promising. Looking at the release schedule, you must remain relatively positive for the second half.\"    \nANDRE MOONS, ING BARINGS\n\"My first reaction is that again it's a stable result, which particularly in a stock market climate like this...is not so inspiring. When you look at the results breakdown, film is a lot lower -- as expected -- and while music did a lot better after correction for currencies and so forth it's not that impressive. Polygram gave no firm forecasts for 1997, although their release schedule for the second half contains some strong acts like Boyz II Men, Shania Twain...and Jackie Cheung. Even so, that's rather an unsteady base on which to project major earnings growth. Film is expected to perform better (in the second half).\nWe have the stock on a Hold recommendation and based on currency strength we expect to maintain this.\"\n-- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040\n","classes":[15,16,44],"classes_pad":null}

It later eased back to 711.44 points, down 0.13 percent at the close on late profit-taking.\nThe index fell 1.6 percent to 712.40 points on Monday as rupiah panic spilled over to the stock market.\n\"It's a volatile day. In general the market has not stabilised yet, but it's better than Monday,\" a currency dealer in Singapore said. The dealer added that there were already customers looking to short the U.S. currency at the 2,600 rupiah level.\nThe rupiah made the largest single-day loss on Monday by plummeting almost five percent to 2,665 against the dollar before recovering slightly to 2,640 at the close.\nThe plunge was larger than when the market was hit by nervousness in July last year over the health of President Suharto and riots in Jakarta.\nHowever, the rupiah recovered with ease on both those occasions, reflecting offshore confidence in Indonesia. But the confidence was shaken in recent weeks after speculative attacks on regional currencies forced devaluations in the Thai baht and the Philippine peso.\nEconomists said the attack on the rupiah had nothing to do with economic fundamentals and represented a contagion effect.\n\"This wave of contagion hitting the regional currencies will be a relatively long-running affair. The danger is that this is a temporary calm we're seeing,\" said Desmond Supple, head of Asian currency research at BZW Asia.\nSupple said a meeting of Asian central bankers in Shanghai later in the week could yield strong verbal support for the region's currencies, but he added that he did not expect it to result in coordinated intervention.\nCurrency dealers said there was a lot of profit-taking in dollars at the opening, pushing the dollar down to the 2,600 level. It tumbled to a low of 2,570 after the central bank intervened, which triggered stop-loss selling in dollars.\n\"The market was looking for signals and directions from the central bank. The bank intervention gave a very good signal in the market and it took the signal by selling dollars down,\" Edwin Png, country treasurer of Bank of America, told Reuters.\nShort-covering helped the dollar recover, but it was still below the psychologically important level of 2,600.\n\"The market is quite reluctant to buy (the dollar) up too high. Anything above the 2,600 level, I think the market is willing to go short again,\" Png said.\nFinance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said on Tuesday the government had no plans to alter monetary policy in the wake of the speculative attack on the rupiah.\nMar'ie said he was confident the market would improve on the back of the country's sound economic fundamentals.\nHe said turmoil in the currency market was speculative and it could not continue for long because speculation implied a hit-and-run strategy.\n","classes":[116,118,123],"classes_pad":null}

Current annual polyolefin capacity at DSM's Geleen plant is 1.52 million.\n\"The polyolefins business is an important and profitable building block in our portfolio,\" DSM chairman Simon de Bree said.\n\"(The deal) secures our existing strong position as supplier of polyethylene well into the first decade of the next century.\"\nThe agreement is aimed at meeting the strong growth in global demand for polyethylene, used in packaging articles such as bottles, bags and films, and polypropylene, used in packaging, textile fibres and plastic car parts.\nDSM said its existing site in Geleen, one of the world's largest integrated production complexes for polyethylene and polypropylene, offered too little scope for expansion.\nConsequently DSM said it was opting for a \"Buy and Build\" approach.\n\"By acquiring an existing site which offers scope for expansion and guarantees a secure supply of ethylene and propylene, DSM can copy its successful 'Geleen model' in polyolefins,\" it said.\nThese feedstocks will be supplied to Gelsenkirchen by Veba Oel from the production plants of of Ruhr Oel, its 50-50 joint venture with Petroleos de Venezuela.\nOn the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, DSM shares opened 5.50 guilders higher on the news at 230.00, touching 233 guilders before settling at 228.50 at mid-morning in a strongly higher market.\nAnalysts were also broadly upbeat on the news, although some said the move had taken them a little by surprise.\n\"We had been expecting an expansion in fine chemicals, and now it's plastics,\" said Patrick Rutten, chemicals analyst with Van Lanschot Bankiers.\n\"Positive is the fact that this will make DSM European market leader by 2001 -- there is sure to be concentration in the sector but DSM has stolen a march on the competition.\"\nHe said the deal was not expected to contribute to earnings in the first two years, but over the longer term it would hike profits per share by an average 4-6 guilders a year over the full industry cycle.\nDSM posted 1996 net profits of 720 million guilders or 23.83 guilders per share, down from a year-earlier 1.07 billion or 29.60 per share.\n-- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040.\n","classes":[25,27,44],"classes_pad":null}

But the move also filtered through to a weaker mark against European units like the French franc, lira and Swedish crown.\nThe Swiss franc too was a major beneficiary of rekindled concerns about the stability of the single currency, reinforced by its traditional haven status and the Swiss economic recovery.\n\"France has effectively given up trying to get to 3.0 percent (budget deficit\/output ratio) this year and Germany has effectively endorsed this,\" said Nick Parsons, foreign exchange strategist at Banque Paribas.\n\"The perception this creates and the comments we've heard from the Bundesbank since can only encourage buying of Swiss francs, as well as the dollar and sterling.\"\nBundesbank council members Hans-Juergen Krupp and and Ernst Welteke stressed late Monday that the Maastricht Treaty does not require a deficit\/GDP ratio of exactly 3.0 pct. Their colleague Hans Juergen Koebnick endorsed that view today.\nKoebnick said he did not think the stability of the euro would be compromised if Germany and France had deficits in the region of 3.2-to-3.3 percent of GDP.\nThe Bundesbank comments followed the announcement from French Finance Minister Dominque Strauss-Kahn on Monday of public deficit cuts worth about 0.4 percent of gross domestic product. The cuts are aimed at reducing a 1997 deficit estimated to be running at between 3.5 and 3.7 percent of GDP at present.\nGerman Finance Minister Theo Waigel said he was convinced  of Strauss-Kahn's commitment to meeting the deficit goals but declined to say whether the French measures Monday were enough.\nWhile there is some debate as to the degree of investor concern about a wide EMU or what exactly a \"soft\" euro would entail, traders said the uncertainty is a major factor.\nOn one hand European inflation and budget deficits are falling, European bonds and equities are robust and the signs gradual economic recovery are evident in Germany.\n\"The problem is what sort of interest rate policy the European central bank will conduct for a wide EMU area,\" said a trader at a UK fund manager in London. \"It's relatively predictable for Germany France and Benelux, but when you include Italy and Spain the picture becomes muddier.\"\nThe market assumption is that if France and Germany agree that overshooting deficit targets is now acceptable, then it will much more difficult to exclude the traditionally volatile Italian lira from the launch of the single currency.\nThe argument is not all one way, however. Some analysts believe a constitutionally independent European central bank will offset any fiscal laxity with a tight monetary policy, not least to establish its inflation-fighting credentials.\nThere is also the fact that European countries starting EMU will have in excess of $200 billion of foreign exchange reserves to defend the new currency.\nThis view is countered, however, by concerns the ECB will come under increasing political influence to keep interest rates low and the exchange rate soft while Europe restructures.\nThe weak state of the European economy was highlighted today by the bigger-than-expected 1.6 percent drop in French industrial output in May.\nAt 0942 GMT, mark\/French franc was at 3.3723\/26 versus 3.3738\/41 late Monday. Mark\/Swiss was at 0.8201\/02 versus 0.8215\/18. Mark\/Swedish crown fell to its lowest since last October and was last at 4.3160\/90 versus 4.3260\/90 Monday.\n--Mike Dolan, London newsroom +44 171 542 6762\n","classes":[116,118,123],"classes_pad":null}

But because it is consultative in nature, the Lib Dem members would not be bound by collective government responsibility.\nOfficials frankly acknowledged that one of the aims of the panel is to bind the Lib Dems closer to Labour in case the ruling party becomes in greater need of parliamentary support than it is now.\n\"We won't have a 179 majority for ever,\" one said.\nThe Liberal Democrats made an electoral breakthrough at the May 1 election, almost doubling their representation in parliament to 46 seats. -- London Newsroom +44 171 5427767\n","classes":[90,104],"classes_pad":null}

Finance and industry minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn offered no guarantee that the FFr32bn public deficit reduction plan, FFr22bn of which will come from companies, would be sufficient to meet the EMU criterion.\n-- BOEING STANDING FIRM OVER SUPPLY CONTRACTS\nOn the eve of the Brussels ruling on the Boeing-McDonnell Douglas merger in which the EC has urged Boeing to drop the 20 year agreements for exclusive aircraft manufacture deals with American, Delta and Continental Airlines, Boeing has offered to reduce the contracts to 13 years only but the Commission has rejected this. The three airlines have emphasised the benefits of only buying from one suppl ier but American have agreed to follow Boeing if they wish to change the exclusivity deal although Delta would not comment. Continental said it would not buy from Airbus Industrie regardless of the exclusivity clause.\n-- SMITH BACKS DOWN ON 'NOT-FOR-PROFIT' LOTTERY POLL PLEDGE\nThe government backed down on a white paper warning by Chris Smith, culture secretary, that the National Lottery would be run on a not-for-profit basis. The election campaign proposal was reversed as Smith conceded that profits may well be vital to ensure efficiency and a well run system. Virgin announced that Richard Branson was no longer interested in the lottery after initially bidding to run the business for no profit.\n-- TESCO HALTS MEAT PURCHASES AFTER TV CLAIMS\nTesco suspended purchases from its biggest meat supplier, St Merryn Meat in Bodmin, Cornwall, prior to the scheduled broadcast of a Granada Television World in Action documentary on the alleged poor practice at the plant. The retail chain has 1billion stg in annual meat sales as the country's biggest butcher and took action as a precaution. Tesco claimed that the suspension has nothing to do with hygiene or safety.\n-- WINDFALL PAYOUT SURVEY ALLAYS SPENDING FEARS\nConsultancy firm Gavin Anderson has revealed survey results that suggest that only eight per cent of the consumers receiving windfall payouts from the year's 30 billion stg building society and life insurer demutualisation will be spending their money immediately. The lower-than-expected spending will help to deter the predicted rises in interest rate and inflation as 56 per cent said they would keep the shares, 22 per cent will convert them to PEPs and 7 per cent said they would invest their share funds into other savings products.\n-- JAPAN'S OKI TO BUILD ADVANCED FAX MACHINE AT SCOTTISH PLANT\nJapanese electronics company Oki Electric has announced plans to base the production of its new range of 'plain paper' fax machines at its Cumbernauld plant near Glasgow. The overseas production investment could create 200-500 new jobs at the 1000-strong workforce plant by early next century and give the company a predicted sales rise of 1.3 million fax machines in Europe by the year 2001.\n-- PRIVATISATION OF AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL URGED\nThe Civil Aviation Authority has told the government that it cannot sustain investment unless the National Air Traffic Service, a CAA wholly owned limited company, is privatised. The department of transport has said that ministers will decide the future of Nats and it is understood that John Prescott, deputy prime minister, is opposed to a 'regulated utility' on the grounds of safety but is not uncompromising in finding private investment.\n-- ACTION URGED ON IT STAFF SHORTAGE\nBarbara Roche, minister for industry, urged businesses to help the government tackle the shortage of trained IT staff in the face of the growing dependence upon computers in the commercial sector. Roche has offered to match any private investment into an IT skills programme and emphasised the sense of urgency in meeting the demands of the future with change needed by the millennium.\n-- SETBACK FOR COURTAULDS AS RIVAL WINS RULING ON PATENT\nBritish-based chemicals company Courtaulds has suffered a legal setback in a battle with rival Austrian company Lenzing over a competitor to its fibre Tencil. The Courtaulds product has won acceptance from retailers and the fashion industry, but the company has been fighting competition from Lenzing's generic version of the fibre, lyocell. The US Court of Appeal has upheld one of Lenzing's patents.\n-- WATERFORD CHIEF URGES BACKING OF MERGER PLAN\nMembers of the milk cooperative of Irish dairy company Waterford Foods have been urged to attend an extraordinary meeting on Friday to back the proposed merger with Avonmore Foods. The plea has been issued by Matt Walsh, group managing director of Waterford, who said the proposed alliance would create arguably the world's fourth largest dairy company.

Bruce Cohen, managing director and chief executive of the group, received a total of 810,000 stg last year, including a salary of 323,000 stg which had increased by 43 per cent on the previous year.\n-- PROFITS PLUNGE 35 PER CENT AT AT&T\nU.S. telecoms company AT & T Corp has reported a 35.6 per cent fall in second-quarter profits, to $959 million net (600 million stg). Robert Allen, chairman and chief executive, said the company's local service efforts had been \"slowed by the foot-dragging of entrenched monopolies\". AT & T had issued a profits warning in March, and Dan Somers, chief financial officer, said he believed this week's results would be the low mark and that future quarters would see improvements.\n-- NATIONWIDE SEEKS EARLY DECLARATION\nNationwide Building Society, Britain's largest building society, is expected to reveal on Tuesday whether it will give the results of elections to its board. The results could determine whether Nationwide remains a mutual, as five rebel candidates are standing on a platform of converting the society to a bank. The deadline for the poll is Tuesday morning, but over one million votes have already been cast.\nTHE TIMES\n-- RAISE TAX TO COOL ECONOMY, IMF ADVISES\nChancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown is expected to receive a warning on Tuesday from the International Monetary Fund that he may have to raise consumer taxes in order to cool the UK economy. A team from the IMF has been holding meetings in London with Brown, the Treasury and the Bank of England over the past 10 days.\n-- CHIEF OF UNITED UTILITIES QUITS IN BOARDROOM RIFT\nShares in multi-utility United Utilities dropped sharply on Monday as the City reacted to the shock resignation of Brian Staples as company's chief executive. The move, which prompted shares to fall 69.5p to 699.5p, comes amid rumours of a bitter boardroom rift. A statement from United said that Staples had left after \"a loss of confidence in him by the board\".\n-- ARNAULT QUITS GUINNESS IN PROTEST\nBernard Arnault, chairman of the French luxury goods firm LVMH which is opposing the proposed merger of Guinness and Grand Metropolitan, has resigned from the board of Guinness. The move was in protest at the \"negative and vitriolic\" response he received from the two suitors to his own alternative proposal for a three-way alliance involving the drinks businesses of Guinness, GrandMet and LVMH.\n- - - -\nTHE GUARDIAN\n-- GERMANY SHAPES UP FOR THE EUROPEAN BANK SHUFFLE\nGerman banks Bayerische Vereinsbank and Beyerische Hypotheken and the Wechelbank have initiated the start of a 12 billion stg merger as part of a two-stage plan which will form a single bank with overall assets of 743 billion marks and a workforce of almost 40,000 sometime early next year. The new alliance will form Europe's second-biggest bank next to Deutsche Bank, but the banking trade union fears job losses of up to 20 per cent. The merger has yet to be confirmed by shareholders and the watchdog commission, but is expected to be approved.\n-- NO DIVIDEND AT SKETCHLEY AFTER GROUP LOSES 4.3 MLN STG\nOwners of SupaSnaps and the dry cleaning chain Sketchley denied shareholders a dividend after announcing a 23 per cent increase in losses of 4.3 million stg on turnover of 157.6 million stg. The Sketchley group, which last year had a 3.5 million stg deficit and announced the closure of 160 of its 720 high street shops, still retained some optimism with the report of growth in its textile services sector. Heavy losses were blamed on the 7.5 million stg one-off cost of the store closures.\n-- SIGNET'S NEW FACETS FAIL SHAREHOLDERS TEST\nThe jeweller Signet has faced fresh calls for its break-up from the UK Active Value Fund following the completion of its capital restructure which converted its ordinary and four preference shares into ordinary shares, leaving the original ordinary shareholders with only 17.5 per cent of the company and the old preference shareholders without receiving 164.5 million stg of owed dividends. UK Active now own six per cent of the company, which announced a 6.6 per cent sales increase in the first half of the year.\n- - - -\nTHE INDEPENDENT\n-- SIEMENS TO PUSH AHEAD WITH SECOND TYNESIDE PLANT\nGerman electronics and engineering giant Siemens AG has revealed it will expand operations at its Tyneside plant, a move which could bring thousands of jobs to the area. Siemens president Heinrich Von Pierer stated plans for the company's second plant in the area would proceed as planned, and a third factory for Tyneside is also being considered. Siemens' talks with General Electric Co Plc (GEC) into the future of its GPT telecoms venture are continuing, with Von Pierer saying it was unlikely that GEC would acquire a 60 per cent stake in the GPT.\n-- MAKEOVER TO COST TESCO 4 MLN STG\nThe 120,000 employees at Britain's largest supermarket chain, Tesco, are to undergo a 4 million stg makeover which will see them issued with a new wardrobe as designed by dry cleaning group Sketchley. Sketchley have spent the past few months consulting with staff on their wardrobe preferences, and as a result staff will now have the option of choosing from a wide variety of styles and colours. Sketchley also have careerwear contracts with Sainsbury and the Rover Group.\n-- DOMECQ BUYS SANDWICH CHAIN\nAllied Domecq has purchased the Togo's chain of 200 U.S. franchised sandwich shops for $50 million (30 million stg) in an attempt to expand its U.S. fast food business.

The number of properties for sale fell by 25 percent.\n\"In the event, the market had little to fear from the budget, although we expect the Chancellor to have abolished MIRAS entirely by 1999,\" Perry said.\nHe said even the widely predicted interest rate rises -- base rates have been ratcheted up to 6.75 percent in three, quarter-point moves since Labour took power on May 1 -- have failed to subdue the market.\n\"Given the shortage of property for sale, we can expect prices to continue to rise over the next 18 months.\"\n($ = 0.595 British Pounds)\n","classes":[13,33,44,55,56,70],"classes_pad":null}

Every girl grows up under the threat of violence,\" she said in a statement. UNICEF released its findings in \"The Progress of Nations\", an annual report that ranks nations on issues affecting the health, welfare and rights of children. Violence against females was highlighted because it affects children around the world and delivers a broad picture on how countries develop, said a spokesman.\nThe report detailed a litany of abuses directed at women and girls -- dowry killings in India, genital mutilation in Africa, domestic violence in the United States or acid hurling in Bangladesh.\nThe report suggests the scope of violence far exceeds earlier estimates, saying 25 to 50 percent of all women have suffered physical abuse at the hands of a partner.\n\"Even in a comparatively open society like the U.S., only one in 100 battered women ever reports the abuse she suffers,\" said UNICEF.\nNor are women the only ones to suffer.\n\"Violence against women also means violence against girls and some types of gender violence specifically target girls,\" said Bellamy.\nSo-called \"son preference\" results in the widespread abortion of female foetuses and the murder of new-born girls occurs in some Asian communities, it said.\nGenital mutilation -- in which all or part of a girl's genitalia are removed -- is common in at least 28 countries, mostly in Africa, it added.\n\"Up to 130 million women and girls today have had their genitals excised,\" said the report.\nAs for solutions: UNICEF urged better schooling for girls and increased legal protection for women.\nOut of 193 nations in the world, just 44 have enacted legislation against domestic violence, 27 have laws against sexual harassment and 17 regard marital rape as a crime, it said. Even in those countries where legislation does exist, the law is not always enforced.\n\"The status quo is intolerable,\" Bellamy said. \"We must insist that violence against girls and women be viewed as a shocking aberration, not an invisible norm.\"\n","classes":[90,93,113],"classes_pad":null}

Despite a strong U.S. economy, inflation seems to be well under control.\nBut Greenspan can always surprise, as he did last December when he warned investors on Wall Street against irrational exuberance. The comment sent stock markets around the globe tumbling, but not for long.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 16.26 points to 7,906.72 on Monday -- 26 percent higher than its close on December 16, the low point after the Greenspan comments.\nGreenspan could still spark market jitters on Tuesday by saying in his twice-yearly Humphrey-Hawkins testimony that strong economic growth could put upward pressure on prices and interest rates later in the year.\nThis might hurt stock and bond markets, but would give support to the dollar which is already powering ahead.\n\"Maybe he will make reference to the exuberance in stocks that he referred to last December, since when the (U.S.) market has gained 25 percent, and he may talk about the outlook for stronger growth,\" said one senior stock dealer in London. \"But ... providing he's not too severe then the markets will probably be OK.\"\nGreenspan's testimony has two legs.

Some slowing in growth was seen over the last three months in the capital but it was still the only area of the country to enjoy significant price rises in recent months.\nPrice increases in the capital have had an impact on adjacent areas but the Nationwide said price rises were weaker further north while the turnover of property transactions has been fairly flat across the country so far this year.\nLondon is no exception in that respect, with turnover at about 13 percent compared with nearly 20 percent at the height of the 1980s boom.\n\"The improvement in the housing market is spreading outwards from London, where demand and supply imbalances are being resolved to some extent,\" said Paul Sanderson, Nationwide's head of research.\n\"However, turnover levels remain relatively low everywhere and contrast sharply with experience during the 1980s.\"\nThere was no sign of equity withdrawal re-emerging on a large scale to fund high street spending. Windfall payments from building societies converting into banks has had a far greater effect there.\n\"There is no evidence that the housing market is directly contributing to consumer demand as it did in the 1980s,\" the Nationwide said.\nThe Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said house prices faltered in June in the run up to Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown's first budget on July 2.\nBut as it turned out it said the budget measures, cutting mortgage interest tax relief and raising stamp duty only on very expensive houses, did little to take any steam out of the market.\nSanderson at Nationwide agreed. \"The recovery clearly has further to go and the outlook should not be significantly affected by the relatively modest measures announced in the Budget,\" he said.\n\"The main risk now is the threat of high interest rates aimed at dampening consumer demand although evidence suggests spending is not being directly driven by the housing market.\"\n-- Mike Peacock, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7708\n","classes":[33,44,68,70],"classes_pad":null}

Last week it announced the sale of 19 shops to rival Marks and Spencer Plc for 192.5 million pounds.  \nReports in the British press on Monday suggested some Littlewoods' shareholders were unhappy with the M&S deal, which will mean redundancies of between 1,700 and 1,800.\nThe articles also gave details of a 540 million stg offer for Littlewoods 135 shops from venture capital firm CVC Partners, which they said was still on the table. But Littlewoods responded saying that CVC had not made a clean cash offer that would have allowed the group to exit the retailing business.\nWhen asked about the press reports and the offer from CVC, Ross said, the board had tested the market and decided not to sell. He said the board had performed the normal job of any board to manage the process and make a recommendation to shareholders.\n\"No board of either a private or a quoted company...goes with all the details of every offer that is made to the shareholders and says please tell us what to do.\"\nHe said all the 32 Moores family members, who own Littlewoods, had signed up to a shareholder charter last April, which separated shareholder and board responsibilities.\nThis aimed to put an end to past squabbles over the direction of the group.\nShareholders will vote on the sale to M&S at a meeting in September, he said.  \n-- London Newsroom + 44 171 542 7717\n","classes":[11,25,27,44],"classes_pad":null}

But the move also filtered through to a weaker mark against European units like the French franc, lira and Swedish crown.\nThe Swiss franc too was a major beneficiary of rekindled concerns about the stability of the single currency, reinforced by its traditional haven status and the Swiss economic recovery.  \n\"France has effectively given up trying to get to 3.0 percent (budget deficit\/output ratio) this year and Germany has effectively endorsed this,\" said Nick Parsons, foreign exchange strategist at Banque Paribas.\n\"The perception this creates and the comments we've heard from the Bundesbank since can only encourage buying of Swiss francs, as well as the dollar and sterling.\"\nBundesbank council members Hans-Juergen Krupp and and Ernst Welteke stressed late Monday that the Maastricht Treaty does not require a deficit\/GDP ratio of exactly 3.0 pct. Their colleague Hans Juergen Koebnick endorsed that view today.  \nKoebnick said he did not think the stability of the euro would be compromised if Germany and France had deficits in the region of 3.2-to-3.3 percent of GDP.\nThe Bundesbank comments followed the announcement from French Finance Minister Dominque Strauss-Kahn on Monday of public deficit cuts worth about 0.4 percent of gross domestic product. The cuts are aimed at reducing a 1997 deficit estimated to be running at between 3.5 and 3.7 percent of GDP at present.\nGerman Finance Minister Theo Waigel said he was convinced of Strauss-Kahn's commitment to meeting the deficit goals but declined to say whether the French measures Monday were enough.  \nWhile there is some debate as to the degree of investor concern about a wide EMU or what exactly a \"soft\" euro would entail, traders said the uncertainty is a major factor.\nOn one hand European inflation and budget deficits are falling, European bonds and equities are robust and the signs gradual economic recovery are evident in Germany.\n\"The problem is what sort of interest rate policy the European central bank will conduct for a wide EMU area,\" said a trader at a UK fund manager in London. \"It's relatively predictable for Germany France and Benelux, but when you include Italy and Spain the picture becomes muddier.\"  \nThe market assumption is that if France and Germany agree that overshooting deficit targets is now acceptable, then it will much more difficult to exclude the traditionally volatile Italian lira from the launch of the single currency.\nThe argument is not all one way, however. Some analysts believe a constitutionally independent European central bank will offset any fiscal laxity with a tight monetary policy, not least to establish its inflation-fighting credentials.\nThere is also the fact that European countries starting EMU will have in excess of $200 billion of foreign exchange reserves to defend the new currency.  \nThis view is countered, however, by concerns the ECB will come under increasing political influence to keep interest rates low and the exchange rate soft while Europe restructures.\nThe weak state of the European economy was highlighted today by the bigger-than-expected 1.6 percent drop in French industrial output in May.\nAt 0942 GMT, mark\/French franc was at 3.3723\/26 versus 3.3738\/41 late Monday. Mark\/Swiss was at 0.8201\/02 versus 0.8215\/18. Mark\/Swedish crown fell to its lowest since last October and was last at 4.3160\/90 compared with 4.3260\/90 Monday.\n--Mike Dolan, London newsroom +44 171 542 6762\n","classes":[116,118,123],"classes_pad":null}

An 11,550-tonne rise on Tuesday brought the total to 195,950 tonnes.\n\"We felt that between 50-70,000 tonnes of copper could have been attracted by the LME. Now we have seen more than 50 (thousand tonnes) going in already,\" Schirmeister said. \"I expect another good tonnage coming up for this week.\"\nAnalysts say some metal is being sucked in by a strong backwardation, other material is arriving due to the summer slowdown while Far East metal ended up in the Singapore warehouse due to lacklustre conditions in the region.\nTechnical tightness caused the cash\/threes backwardation to flare to $270 last week and the nearby spreads to trade up to LME-imposed limits. LME chief executive David King said last week he was continuing to watch the copper market.\nIn response to a question, Schirmeister said to his knowledge, MG had not been contacted by the LME regarding the latest backwardation.\nThe MG official said he was not bothered by market talk suggesting that MG holds long positions and squeezes the market.\nMG was one of the largest LME brokers and its primary focus was keeping its clients happy, he said.\nThe market has been wrong about a looming surplus for the past three years due to higher than expected consumption and delays in getting new mines on line.\n\"At the moment we would call it a balanced market...but it will definitely swing over to higher production in coming years...not '97 but '98 could be the first one,\" he said.\nSchirmeister said the market would be in surplus when the balance was tipped by 100,000 tonnes, since often there was that much tonnage in the pipeline being delivered throughout the world. --Eric Onstad, London Newsroom +44 171 542-8065\n","classes":[119,121,123],"classes_pad":null}

So we will aim for organic growth,\" Stagecoach group finance director, Brian Cochrane, told Reuters in an interview.\nHe said the main tools for this would be new pricing initiatives and promotions. But he added Stagecoach was continuing to scour the Continent for a follow-up deal to its SweBus(Swedish Bus)acquisition last year.  \nThe finance chief said the group was more likely to target overseas deals in buses before rail. \"The bus market is at a more advanced stage (in the privatisation process).\n\"So it is likely we will initially make deals on the bus side. But in the long-term we would like to capitalise on our experience with SWT (South West Trains rail franchise) and Porterbrook (the rolling stock group).\"\nCochrane said the group remained confident that even without deal-making in the UK it could maintain passenger growth in its domestic bus business. It reported passenger growth of 1.7 percent last year against a market that declined by 2-2.5 percent.  \nBarry Hinkley, executive director with responsibility for buses, told Reuters this constituted real growth of four percent and he was confident the pace could continue.\nBut one problem area in the overseas bus empire is African business in Malawi and Kenya.\nThe Malawi business is seen to be more problematic, with margins being eroded by unregulated competition in the country.\nCochrane said the business was under review as a result. \"The business has suffered and we are looking at the options open to us. One option is to downsize the business to a profitable core and focus on the intercity routes.\"  \nThe Kenyan woes stem from the recent flaring up of political unrest due to demands by opposition politicians for democratic elections. Stagecoach was less perturbed by this development, however, seeing the situation eventually resolving itself.\nTurning to the impact of the strong pound on its financial performance, Cochrane said its effect had been fairly limited so far and mainly stemmed from sterling's appreciation against the Swedish currency, with the exposure in Africa fairly limited due to the small size of the operations.\nBut he refused to be drawn on the current year's potential impact as the pound flirts above the three Deutsche mark level.  \nHe added the threat of higher interest rates being levied on Stagecoach's sizeable debt was not a pressing concern as 95 percent of the group's interest costs were fixed.\nCochrane said group gearing had been reduced \"substantially\" over the last year \"reflecting the strong cash generation of our businesses.\" Stagecoach was therefore not constrained by its debt in future expansion ambitions, he said.\n--By Edna Fernandes, London newsroom +44 171 5427717.\n","classes":[11,15,18,25,26,44],"classes_pad":null}

This general uncertainty is expected to limit the FTSE's near-term upside to around the 4,820 level, they said.\nBut a positive view is that by not beating the FTSE down below 4,800 on Monday, market bears have allowed the bulls an opportunity to make a stand around current levels.  \nThe market had appeared technically overbought late last week but the 143-point plunge since then has made the FTSE's short-term oscillators now show neutral readings.\nAmid such readings, the market has an evens chance of making a swift recovery, analysts said.\nBut trend analysis of the market -- using trendlines and moving averages -- suggest the probability is more in favour of a cautious move up with the FTSE's 20-day moving average providing near-term support.\nThe 20 day average is currently at 4,787.\n-- Pradip Mishra, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7954\n","classes":[114,123],"classes_pad":null}

The use of charge caps, like the familiar caps on retail prices, at the wholesale level is a new approach. It is much less interventionist than the current system under which Oftel determines the exact price for interconnection services. It will ensure that the sort of efficiency improvements that would be expected in a competitive market will be reflected in network charges.\nCruickshank said the system for assessing interconnection charges -- to such operators as Cable & Wireless Communications Plc -- would be changed from one based on historic, fully allocated costs to one based on forward-looking incremental costs.\nThe industry, including BT, agree this is the right way forward as do other regulators around the world, he said.\n\"Since historic costs are higher than future costs, the change means there is a reduction in the charges that will start from 1 October, compared with those that apply under the present arrangements. I expect this to be of the order of 10 percent.\"\n\"UK interconnection costs are already among the lowest in the world. Today's announcement means they are set to fall further still.

[CORRECTED 07:45 GMT]","text":"\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday praised the \"excellent start\" made by Britain's Labour government and said interest rates might not need to rise as far as markets expect to head off the threat of inflation.\nIn the conclusion to its annual review of Britain's economy, released by the Treasury, the Fund also said it expected the pound sterling to fall back from its current six-year highs.\n\"The new government has made an excellent start. It has set a high standard for its economic policies, aiming to maintain stability and foster long-term growth while seeking fairness and developing human potential.\n\"And it has taken decisive steps toward these goals by making the Bank of England independent, introducing a budget that makes rapid strides toward sound public finances, and initiating welfare-to-work and other programmes to enhance employability,\" the Washington-based IMF said.\nThe Fund said the policies put in place since Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labour party swept to power on May 1 were timely because of looming imbalances (corrects from \"balances\") in the economy.\nDomestic demand was surging, and may gather further strength because of windfalls from the stock market flotation of building societies (mortgage lenders), just as exporters start to feel the pinch from the strength of sterling.\n\"With output now close to potential and the associated risks of rekindling inflation, the economy faces a period of increased uncertainty. Encouragingly the fiscal and monetary policies should alleviate these tensions significantly,\" the IMF said.\nIt said the budget unveiled by Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, Britain's finance minister, on July 2 could have been tilted more heavily against free-spending consumers.\nBut it was difficult to criticise the scale of the fiscal tightening, which should slow the upswing in the economy and set the public finances on a sound medium-term track, it added.\nThe IMF welcomed the three quarter-point rises in British interest rates since the election, saying they were overdue.\nFurther action would probably be required but \"with substantial fiscal and monetary tightening in the pipeline interest rates may not need to rise as far as markets expect\".\nThe IMF said sterling's strength complicated the task of steering the economy. As the surge \"appears unsustainable and, according to market expectations, temporary\", it was uncertain to what extent it would help slow growth by reducing exports.\nBrown welcomed the report. \"This is a ringing endorsement of the government's economic policies from the world's most respected international monetary body,\" he said in a statement.\nThe IMF applauded the government's emphasis on labour market flexibility and initiatives to ease the unemployed back into work.\nBut it said the welfare-to-work programme, which subsidises firms to take on unemployed young people for six months, would have to be implemented skillfully to achieve its objectives.\nThe Fund was also doubtful about another cherished Labour policy, the national minimum wage. It called it \"a blunt instrument for achieving a fair income distribution and a two-edged sword for rewarding work if set too high\".\nIt suggested a lower set of wage rates for young people to ensure they would not be priced out of the labour market.\nThe IMF also said Brown's \"golden rule\" on public borrowing, which says the government may borrow only to fund investment over the course of the business cycle, lacked ambition.\nIt said the government should aim to balance its books completely to release extra resources for private investment.\nThe IMF welcomed changes in corporate taxation made in the budget, including the abolition of tax credits offered to pension funds on dividend payments.\nBut it urged the government to reconsider its refusal to extend value added tax to a wider range of goods.

Haiveta sat in his usual chair at Skate's right hand during the vote.\nSkate's shock election resulted from a last-minute deal under which his party, the People's National Congress, and other small parties and independents backed the former government.\nOn Sunday, Skate's People's National Congress was still siding with Somare, but political analysts said Somare's refusal to allow Skate the top job saw him defect late on Monday.\nThe back-room deal rescued the former ruling coalition, the People's Progessive Party (PPP) and Pangu party, from political oblivion after it was decimated in the June election.\nA voter backlash against the former government over alleged political corruption and the hiring of African mercenaries to end the secessionist revolt on Bougainville saw 15 ministers, including Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan, lose their seats.\nChan's hiring of mercenaries sparked an army revolt and two days of looting in March in the capital Port Moresby -- the country's worst political crisis since independence in 1975.\nSkate had campaigned heavily for the removal of Chan during the crisis, but in the end Chan was said to be key to wooing Skate's support for his coalition.\nAsked by reporters how he could now side with his rivals, Skate said: \"Papua New Guinea has its own way of playing politics, it is not for foreigners, outsiders, to come here and dictate how we run our politics.\"\nSkate said he would investigate a series of corruption charges, including those linked to the $36 million contract with British military consultancy Sandline International.\n\"We will not be vindictive, but we will look at all the issues, including Sandline...,\" said Skate, who during the June elections said he would never join forces with the PPP-Pangu parties. The two parties are the largest in the new parliament with 16 and 15 seats respectively.\nSkate is expected to be a dove on his country's most intractable problem, the nine-year revolt on Bougainville, and said on Tuesday that peace rested with the island's people.\n\"The people of Bougainville are crying out for peace, my government will listen to what they want,\" Skate said. \"It is up to Bougainvilleans to find a solution to the problem.\"\nSkate was born in 1953 and has a degree in accountancy from the University of Technology in the city of Lae.

A rush of funds out of the mark also provided a cushion on the crosses.\nBut dealers felt the market mood remained bearish in expectation inflation figures Wednesday would prove so benign the Reserve Bank would have little choice but to ease policy, so taking official rates here below those in the U.S.  \nBy 5.00 pm (0700 GMT) the local currency was calm for the moment at US$0.7400\/10 having edged up from a US$0.7390 low, but remained short of the US$0.7415\/20 seen late here Monday.\nDealers said offers were crowded around US$0.7440 and chart resistance lay thick in the US$0.7475\/80 area.\nSupport was put at US$0.7385 and US$0.7340, while a break of last week's US$0.7310 trough was needed to signal yet another phase of the four month-old, five cent-wide downtrend.\nThe New Zealand dollar was down at US$0.6490\/95 having crumbled from US$0.6540 during the selling burst, while on the crosses the A$ was up at NZ$1.1393\/18 from NZ$0.1321\/30.  \nAgainst the yen the local dollar nudged up to 86.09\/19 from 85.75\/85 late Monday while in trade weighted terms it firmed to 57.4 from 57.3.\nDealers said the dollar was going nowhere ahead of the long-anticipated inflation numbers, although it was harder to predict the market's likely reaction than the data themselves.\nThe median forecast for the underlying measure, which the RBA is pledged to keep in a 2-3 percent band over an economic cycle, favours a 0.4 percent rise for the quarter. That would see annual growth slow to 1.7 percent from 2.1 in Q1, the lowest reading since the series began in 1971.  \nThe consumer price index was seen actually falling by 0.1 percent, the first drop since June 1992, which would leave annual growth at just 0.5 percent from 1.3 percent.\nMany analysts figured the RBA would be hard pressed not to ease in response to what was, after all, deflation and could move as soon as Friday morning.\nMuch depended, however, on what the volatile measure of average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) for Q2 had to say about wages growth when released on Thursday.\nThe market has been sanguine about the release up to now, a risky attitude given it has a habit of non-conformism.  \nThe original Q1 release, for instance, showed a much stronger than expected rise in growth to 4.6 percent which had been taken as lessening the chance of a rate cut. The final figures, however, were revised to show a rise of only 4.3 percent and the day after their release the RBA cut rates.\nMedian forecasts for Q2 are for earnings to rise 0.8 percent in Q2, which would see annual growth slow to 4.1 percent from 4.3 percent in Q1 and thus be no impediment to a move.\nDie-hard A$ bulls found some comfort in wages data from HSBC Markets which showed major enterprise deals in the June quarter were up at 4.9 percent, well above the 4.0 percent seen in Q1.  \nThe HSBC report on wages stirred some speculation the weekly earnings data might not be as subdued as the market currently expected. However, analysts noted enterprise deals made up only about 1\/3 of all settlements and it was still likely award payments were depressed enough to drag down AWOTE.\nOffshore markets, however, would be more concerned with what Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan had to say at his Humphrey Hawkins testimony on the U.S. economy to Congress today.

At the time he said the industry would be consulted on its features but the government's plan was to phase it in in two stages, commencing at 1.25 percent from January 1, 1998, and rising to 2.5 percent by July 1999.  \nThe measure was designed to raise A$19 million in 1997\/98 and A$70 million annually at the 2.5 percent rate.\nBut last week Resources Minister Colin Barnett said the recent fall in the gold price had prompted the government to propose delaying the January 1 introduction of the first stage.\nHe also said the government was prepared to negotiate further on \"having a second component to the royalty to be tied to the price of gold\".\nOn Tuesday, Court said he believed the royalty negotiations will be completed within a fortnight.  \n\"It (the deferral proposal) will involve the government having to defer some of the dates in relation to its application but in the past we have made it very clear that whenever a mining company has difficulty with royalties we are prepared to assist them in the short term over that difficult period,\" Court said.\n\"We've made a commitment that we were going to introduce a gold royalty but at the same time we made an announcement that we would negotiate with the industry as to how it would be introduced.  \n\"(In relation to) the second phase of the royalty, we also had it in mind to put a floor price on so that would not come into being if it fell below a certain price, and that is one of the areas that we are currently negotiating with the industry.\n\"The talks are going well and I hope we can reach an amicable agreement,\" Court said.\nWestern Australia, Australia's leading gold producing state, has not previously imposed a royalty on gold production, unlike the other Australian states, although other minerals are subject to royalties.\n-- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373-1800\n","classes":[13,44,55,56,70],"classes_pad":null}

Opening rains have been very favourable across much of New South Wales (NSW), Queensland and Western Australia,\" Flugge said in a speech released here.\nThe timing and distribution of further rainfall during winter would determine the scope for Australia's wheat production in 1997\/8, he said.\n\"It is always difficult to give any forecast of the Australian wheat crop this early in the season and the El Nino phenomenon makes it particularly difficult this year,\" he said.  \nFlugge said the AWB had recently revised its national wheat crop estimate to 15 to 16 million tonnes from 18 million tonnes.\nThe AWB chief's view of prospects for Australia's 1997\/98 wheat crop was echoed by other grains industry leaders at the conference.\nXavier Martin, chairman of NSW Farmers' grains committee, said the 1997\/98 crop \"stands on a knife-edge\".\n\"In much of the state (of NSW) rain is desperately needed,\" he said.  \n\"At the same time, prices are looking relatively lacklustre and we need a significant lift in prices. I am slightly more optimistic about that than I am about all regions receiving timely rains,\" he said.\nTraders believed international wheat prices had hit bottom, Flugge told the conference.\nAWB estimated increasing demand for 1997\/98, he said. \"Stronger world wheat demand should continue to keep pace with increasing wheat supplies, however it is unlikely that world stocks will be drawn down in 1997\/98,\" Flugge said.  \n\"World ending stocks are likely to build by around five million tonnes, easing further the tightness that characterised the wheat balance sheet in early 1996\/97.\"\nFlugge said the AWB believed 1997\/98 export availability from the five major wheat exporters was likely to decline by 17-18 million tonnes from 1996\/97, with Australia, Argentina and Canada to experience lower wheat production.\nLarger production from former Soviet Union republics and Eastern Europe was likely to produce significantly higher wheat exports from these countries, making up some of the shortfall, he said.  \nOverall import demand in 1997\/98 was expected to increase by about two million tonnes, with stronger import demand in western and southern Asia and northern Africa, he said.\nChina was likely to import only 3.5 million tonnes of wheat in 1997\/98, slightly more than in 1996\/97 but well down from the 12 million tonnes imported in 1995\/96, he said. This followed steadily increasing Chinese self-sufficiency, he said.\nThe prospect of a re-emergence of European Union (EU) wheat export subsidies was a market focus as the EU 1997\/98 wheat marketing campaign neared, Flugge said.  \n\"However, the risk of overheating EU domestic wheat prices as well as budgetary concerns should see the EU avoiding such aggressive tactics if possible, at least in the near term,\" he said.\nThe U.S. was similarly likely to wish to avoid the use of subsidies in the absence of competitor subsidies, he said.\n-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800\n","classes":[29,44,119,120,123],"classes_pad":null}

The highest estimate was a modest 0.2 percent and a handful reckoned the fall could be as large as 0.3 percent.  \nThe improvement has largely been driven by falling mortgage charges which reflects both increased competition amongst lenders and past cuts in official interest rates.\nAll analysts agreed the achievement was an impressive one.\nWhen the heady pace of economic growth in 1994 looked to be stoking inflation and threatening the RBA's 2-3 percent target the bank hiked rates three times in five months.\nThe pre-emptive strike ensured the underyling rate peaked at just 3.3 percent in Q1 1996, compared to a high in the previous cycle of 9.9 percent in 1986 and a sky-high peak for the series of 21.9 percent during the oil price shock of the early 1970s.  \nThe resulting slowdown of price growth has also been brisk compared to the glacial pace of past improvements, giving rise to much speculation that a new, low inflation era had dawned.\n\"Looking from here, it stretches as far as the eye can see,\" said Koukoulas. \"Our model for underlying inflation shows it not moving above two percent until next year and not troubling three percent until 1999,\" he said.\nThere was a caveat, however, in that this assumed no lasting weakness in the Australian dollar.\nBut DMG's Meer reckoned the depreciation in the currency so far -- around six percent this year -- was not yet a threat.  \n\"Industry has no pricing power at the moment so even if import prices rise they can't pass it on to the consumer,\" he said.\n-- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373 1800\n","classes":[48,49,62,70,90,100],"classes_pad":null}

These containers come in and out of Auckland on major international lines and then are transported to other New Zealand centres by road, rail or on coastal shipping services.\"  \nVazey said there was strong growth in volumes in the second half of the financial year. Container throughput between January and June 1997 was 245,000 TEU's compared to 219,000 TEU's between June and December 1996.\n\"We enjoyed very strong growth in the second half year because there were high volumes of containerised exports, particularly dairy products.\"\nVazey said the port had achieved excellent volume growth in spite of mixed economic conditions through the year, largely because of its investments made to attract hub services.  \nMore than 50 percent of New Zealand's total container trade comes through Auckland. In order to accommodate the continuing growth in the container trade through Auckland, the company plans to upgrade and extend Fergusson Container Terminal.\nIt has also invested $35 million to develop Bledisloe Container Terminal as a specialised container facility.

The Nikkei 300 was down 1.29 points or 0.43 percent at 298.09.\nMarket participants were keen to see if any comments from Greenspan affect Wall Street stocks.\nBut most brokers in Tokyo said there would be no major change in U.S. monetary policy amid tamed inflation.\n\"Some investors paused in the Tokyo market today, as they wanted to wait for further data about the state of the Japanese economy in the later half of this business year,\" Dai-Ichi's Orimi said.\nAn Economic Planning Agency (EPA) official said on Tuesday that Japan's diffusion index of leading economic indicators for June was likely to be below the \"boom-or-bust\" figure of 50.\nEarlier on Tuesday, the EPA announced that the index for leading indicators in May was 33.3.\nthe official said the fact that the index has been below 50 for several months does not necessarily mean Japan's economy is going to slow down in the near future. Among high-tech shares, Hitachi Ltd fell 30 yen to 1,280 on trade of 4.018 million shares, the third-most actively traded issue on the first section.\nFujitsu Ltd also lost 30 yen to end at 1,660. Turnover was 4.01 million shares, the fourth-heaviest volume on the first section.\nSome semiconductor-related issues also fell. Shares of Advantest Corp fell 380 yen to 9,820. Tokyo Electron Ltd slid 490 yen to end at 6,820. \"High-tech shares such as Advantest and Tokyo Electron had been surging in recent sessions and were ready for a break,\" said Harushige Kobayashi, Yamaichi Securities deputy general manager. Shares of Honda Motor Co Ltd recovered. They rose 80 yen to close at 3,470. Honda was sold heavily on Friday due to a report that U.S. car dealers were asking a judge to grant class-action status for lawsuits against Honda following a kickback scandal.\nA federal judge in Baltimore said on Friday he would most likely deny the bid for class-action status. By sector, decliners were led by securities, trading houses, oil, electrical equipment and precision instruments. The major gainers were air transport, credit\/lease and electric power shares. The second section index was down 11.45 points at 1,799.32, with 5.74 million shares traded. The over-the-counter (OTC) index was down 8.76 points at 1,158.09.\n-- Hiroko Nakata, Tokyo Equities Desk +81-3-3432-8027\n","classes":[114,123],"classes_pad":null}

The danger is that this is a temporary calm we're seeing,\" said Desmond Supple, head of Asian currency research at BZW Asia.\nSupple said the central bankers meeting could yield strong verbal support for the region's currencies but added that he did not expect it to result in actual coordinated intervention.\n\"There's a broad-based reassessment of risk-reward valuations in the region. Given that genuine funds are leaving as well as speculators, that significantly increases the cost to the real economy of any intervention,\" he said.\nIn Malaysia, the ringgit also received a boost from Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's comments expressing displeasure with the recent speculative assault on the currency.\nPress reports quoted Mahathir, due to return to Malaysia after a two-month absence on Tuesday, as saying there may have been a political agenda behind the recent moves in regional currency markets.\n\"That's a very strong statement from him. So those funds which were very long (dollars) below the 2.60 level started to take profit,\" a European bank dealer in Singapore said.\nHe said the ringgit had already depreciated by over five percent from a recent high of 2.49 and operators were reluctant to push it towards a low of 2.65 to the dollar.\nThe ringgit hit a 38-month low of 2.6450 in London markets on Friday.\n\"The moves have been on very thin volume. It's been purely a speculative attack and the market will see that Malaysia's not as bad as perceived,\" he said.\nBut he added that domestic dollar demand from corporate parties caught out by the dollar's sharp run-up would limit the ringgit's upside and the dollar should find good support at the psychological 2.60 ringgit level for the time being.\nThe ringgit was quoted at 2.6170\/200 to the dollar at 0415 GMT against 2.6250\/300 at its Kuala Lumpur close on Monday.\nFurther south, the Singapore dollar firmed above the 1.46 level against its U.S. counterpart as players turned less bearish after the release of positive trade data on Monday.\nSingapore's non-oil domestic exports rose a nominal 8.8 percent year-on-year in June against forecasts of a 6.3 percent nominal rise after May's 1.0 percent fall.\nComments by government officials predicting a turnaround in global electronics demand in the coming months also supported sentiment, dealers said.\nElectronic exports account for about 70 percent of Singapore's non-oil domestic exports.\nThe dealer said wariness of possible central bank resistance was also preventing operators from pushing the Singapore dollar down towards 1.47 to the U.S. dollar.\nHe said local corporates had sold about $100 million from the 1.4630\/40 levels but the U.S. dollar was likely to meet fresh buying interest around 1.4550.\nIn Indonesia, the rupiah hovered around the 2,600 to the dollar level after falling prey to an aggressive attack on Monday.\n\"It's a fight to break the 2,600 resistance level for the rupiah. Singapore players are defending the resistance. We are waiting to see who has more bullets,\" a U.S. bank dealer in Jakarta said. He added that local operators were steadily unloading dollars.\n\"If the 2,600 level is broken, the dollar can fall all the way down to as low as 2,570,\" a local bank dealer said.\nHe said many operators could be forced to cut losses in the afternoon when London markets open if the rupiah broke the 2,600 resistance level.\nThe rupiah became the latest victim of a speculative attack on Monday, plunging about 150 points to a historic 2,665 low against the dollar before staging a marginal recovery on central bank intervention.\nIndonesian Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said on Tuesday the attack on the rupiah was not related to fundamentals and that the government had no plans to change its monetary policy.\nThe Thai baht lost ground in domestic markets, where players returned from a long weekend and fretted about the impending release of data on financial institutions' non-performing loans. The baht was quoted at 30.880\/30.980 to the dollar in the local market versus 30.42\/30.47 baht late Friday.\n\"The baht was fluctuating quite a bit this morning. But the market was thin, so even a small transaction could move the market,\" a U.S. bank dealer in Bangkok said.\n-- Syed Azman in Kuala Lumpur (603-206 2323), Mantik Kusjanto in Jakarta (6221 384-6364), Anchalee Koetsawang in Bangkok (662) 652-0642, Lilian Karunungan in Manila (632-841-8937) and Sonali Desai in Singapore (65-8703090)\n","classes":[116,118,123],"classes_pad":null}

The one-year IRS was quoted at 0.79\/0.83 percent at 0630 GMT, down from Friday's 0.80\/0.84 percent.\nThe BOJ left the market with a 200 billion yen surplus in its regular money market operation on Tuesday, in order to fend off upward pressure on rates in the short end of the market.\nThe call rate firmed slightly, however, to 0.50-0.51 percent from Friday's 0.49 percent.

In U.S. dollar terms two to three billion is what they (Bank Negara) have spent in the last few weeks, from mid-May to second week of July,\" said Daniel Lian, regional economist with NatWest Markets in Singapore.\nThe pressure on the ringgit increased over the last two weeks after Thailand allowed the baht to float and the Philippines widened the peso's trading band, both effectively devaluing their currencies.\nOn July 8, Bank Negara struck heavily against speculators, selling between $1 billion to $2 billion to prop up the ringgit.\nAfter an initial defence, Bank Negara since last week has allowed the ringgit to fall against the dollar. The Malaysian unit fell to a 38-month low of 2.6450 to a dollar on Friday, or over 5.5 percent lower than the 2.5050 level two weeks ago.\nAt 0900 GMT on Tuesday, the ringgit was at 2.6225\/45 to a dollar.\nEconomists said the fall in reserves will not have any impact on the economy as Malaysia's reserves were more than adequate to provide it a comfortable import cover.\n\"It is not a shocking number. It will not have very much impact on the economy,\" said Lian.\n\"Normally a decline in reserves means a decline in money supply. That can be offset by more generous injections of liquidity into the system,\" he said.\nWith the decline of nearly nine billion ringgit ($3.46 billion) in its foreign exchange reserves, \"it (the intervention) could not have gone on for too long,\" said Eddie Lee, chief economist at Vickers Ballas in Singapore.\nForeign exchange reserves as at July 15, 1996 amounted to 66.68 billion ringgit, showing a fall of 4.78 billion ringgit on a year-on-year basis.\nTotal assets stood at 96.82 billion ringgit on July 15 against 100.99 billion ringgit on June 30, but were slightly higher than 95.72 billion ringgit a year ago.\nCurrency in circulation stood at 22.07 billion ringgit, compared to 21.95 billion ringgit in June.\n\"It actually does not mean the country is any poorer, if the ringgit recovers, they (Bank Negara) could recoup the losses,\" said Lian.\nEconomists said they applauded Bank Negara's policy of not defending the ringgit further.\n\"In the past week Bank Negara has let the ringgit float more freely. Already they have chosen the wiser path,\" said Lee at Vickers Ballas.\n-- Kuala Lumpur newsroom (603-206 2323)\n","classes":[64,67,70],"classes_pad":null}

If Bangkok Bank is 25 percent of the banking industry and if they are feeling the pain as they clearly are, it doesn't bode well for everybody else,\" he said.\nThe profit results may now unnerve investors who were greeted by healthy-looking earnings figures from smaller banks last week, analysts said.\nSome commercial lenders were yet to make the fullest possible preparations to ride out the downturn in the economic cycle, Pithi said.\n\"I don't think some of us have actually faced reality and admitted that we have problems. The thing to do is admit your problems and provide a suitable remedy to the situation,\" Pithi said.\nInterest rates might now rise in the short term and analysts said banks' decision to raise deposit rates last week signalled intensifying competition for deposits which could further squeeze bank profits this year.\n\"It suggests the banks are not entirely confident themselves of the extent of foreign capital inflows so the knock-on affect is a squeeze on domestic funding costs,\" said the analyst.\n\"Can you pass that on to your borrowers? Probably not at the moment because they are struggling already,\" he said. ($1 = 30 baht)\n","classes":[15,16,44],"classes_pad":null}
