It said it wanted to take over all of GAN and a maximum of 25 percent of CIC, GAN's profitable banking network.\nGAN shares were up 3.15 percent at 150.60 francs after the announcement, outpacing the overall Paris market.\nEureko executive director Ernst Jansen said the amount of the offer would hinge on conditions the government imposed on the sale and a planned state recapitalisation of GAN, which lost 5.7 billion francs last year because of bad property deals.\nThe previous conservative government announced in February a 20 billion franc rescue which still awaits approval by the European Commission.\nDespite its troubles, GAN has become widely sought after in the consolidation wave sweeping the global insurance market.\nFrench insurer AGF, Allianz AG of Germany, Fortis AG, Assicurazioni Generali SpA of Italy and ING Groep of the Netherlands have either expressed interest in acquiring GAN or are likely candidates, GAN chairman Didier Pfieffer has said.\nFrench mutual insurer MAAF has also said it would like to team up with other firms to buy GAN.\nRetreating from its anti-privatisation stand, the government said on Friday it would not block the sale planned by the conservatives of GAN and CIC, one of France's 10 largest banks.\nJansen told Reuters the group aimed to merge GAN with the Dutch holding company and \"bring the totality back to the stock exchange in two or three years\". Shares would be listed in Paris, Amsterdam and London.\n\"Our intention is to put more and more operations into Eureko as a common company. GAN would give a lot of content and we would add money and businesses,\" he said in an interview.\nEureko could offer a \"national solution\" for GAN, he said. It would maintain GAN \"in its integrity... we would maintain the brand name. We have good geographical complementarity for GAN's international positions. We think we have a very good offer.\"\nThe government said last week national interests \"could be respected so long as (GAN and CIC) are integrated in larger entities capable of giving them the means to develop.\"\nEureko, founded in 1992, is made up of Dutch Achmea, BCP\/Atlantico of Portugal, French Provident, Parion of Germany, Danish Topdanmark and Wasa of Sweden.\nJansen said Eureko had been in touch with the government about its interest and decided to go public after the government gave the green light to the sale. \"We have been a bit of a dark horse.\"\nGAN had an interesting brand and a good commercial network, he said. \"We're interested in the relationship with CIC and its bancassurance links,\" he said.\n\"We'd like to talk to people who are interested in CIC to see whether they're interested in us taking a minority role to maintain that bancassurance link,\" he said.\nLast year, the conservative government had to cancel the sale of CIC, which had 1996 profits of 847 million francs, because of a shortage of bids considered suitable.\nEureko has named merchant bank Merrill Lynch as its adviser.\n","classes":[25,26,44],"classes_pad":[25,26,44,"-1","-1","-1","-1","-1","-1","-1","-1","-1","-1"]}

Because of this I did not give my permission for the sale,\" he said.\nRexrodt made it clear that he thought the 7,500 jobs at K&S were just as safe, regardless of whether or not it was sold.\nPossible monopolistic price hikes were one of the dangers to the public good, Rexrodt said. K&S already has a near monopoly in Germany with 80 percent of the market, and if the merger had gone ahead it would have dominated the market.\nBASF still wants to sell its 51-percent K&S stake, and it said it did not rule out any course of further action at the moment, either by selling shares on the bourse or by seeking another industrial partner.\nThe remaining 49 percent in K&S belongs to the east German development agency BvS.\nPCS chairman Charles Childers said that the group would review the purchase of K&S after the Rexrodt decision.\n\"While we are disappointed with the ruling, we must respect the decision of the Minister and we will now thoroughly review our position,\" Childers said.\nThe IGBE mining and energy union said its immediate concerns lay with employees at K&S and related industries.\n\"With this decision, the opportunity to secure the future of the German potash industry has been missed. The 7,500 jobs have to be secured,\" the IGBE said in a statement.\nThe opposition Social Democrats (SPD) were disappointed.\n\"The future with a new shareholding partner is unclear. But we want to see support for one of the most important economic sectors in northern and eastern Hessen,\" SPD representatives Eberhard Fischer and Ilse Stiewitt said in a statement.\nBASF said that the merger as planned would have ensured the continued employment of K&S's 7,500 employees, as well as employment in related areas, and \"would have greatly improved Kali & Salz's competitiveness in the future.\"\nBASF on its own had only limited chances of turning the company into a global competitor because of overcapacity in the potash fertiliser market.\nOriginally the German cartel office blocked the sale, citing possible dominance of the German potash market.\nPotash and BASF could have applied to Berlin courts to have the cartel watchdog decision overturned, but instead it opted to ask Rexrodt, who can overturn a cartel office decision if there are overrriding implications for the economy or for employment.\n\"Clearly these paragraphs in German competition law are based on ensuring the public interest is served. But the real struggle for existence is being fought on a transparent and hard-fought global market,\" Wolf said.\nRalf Bethke, management board chairman of K&S, said: \"This is very bad news for the company. Now we have to reassure our employees and their representatives, who supported the planned merger, that we will do our best to continue our operations.\"\n","classes":[25,26,43,44,62,70,90,100],"classes_pad":[25,26,43,44,62,70,90,100,"-1","-1","-1","-1","-1","-1","-1","-1","-1","-1"]}

Castle (R-Del) -- \"Would you agree that there is a need for a mechansism in the ... balanced budget agreement to require action if spending targets are not met in future years?\"\nGreenspan: \"In retrospect, the caps have worked remarkably well, surprisingly well. I'm ... more congenial towards that sort of mechanism, because when you are dealing with the type of budgetary structure that we have, they serve a very useful purpose in containing the level of expenditures to the level of receipts (balance) the Congress decides. Without it, it is rather difficult.\nRep. Frank: \"You and other (Fed) members ... believe in a non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment ... Is there any evidence that we are likely to need any kind of rate increase to stave off inflation in 1998?\nGreenspan: \"Me and my colleages attempt to try to explain as best we can what we think is going in the economy and how it interfaces with monetary policy ... What we try to do when dealing with complex situation which is very clearly changing ... things are happening today which don't follow the normal experience of the last 10 or 15 years. What that does is it raises a flag saying the models that one has been working with clearly are not producing the results which the real world is producing -- something is wrong, obviously it's not the real world.\nThe problem that you have to ask yourself is:  How much of the changes that you are looking at are so fundamental that those older models are completely worthless, or are you dealing with either minor or moderately significant changes? And all I'm saying to you ... that while there is no question that something different is happening, you cannot basically say that because something different is happening, therefore all history is irrelevant.\nObviously, one wouldn't want to say that. The question is: What's the appropriate balance of adjustment to one's judgment as to what are the forces currently driving the economy, and, therefore, how we as central bankers interface with those forces.\nThere are differences within the FOMC as there are differences with any committee. There are no differences with respect to the ultimate goal of monetary policy. There are no differences, as far as I can judge, in the general belief that low inflation or stable prices significantly contributes, if not fully a necessary condition, for long-term economic growth. There are differences in the committee in evaluating what is currently happening and how much of the historic model is still functioning and is not functioning -- that is what the debate is currently involved with.\nRep. Frank: \"I just hope that you will decide by the preponderance of evidence, and not say that the good news has to prove itself beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\nGreenspan: \"I couldn't agree with you more. It's not a good news-bad news, it's a preponderance of the evidence and the facts, which I hope determine what we do, and I can certainly tell you that that is our purpose.\"\nRep. Paul: \"In the last three months ... the foreign central banks were holding a lot less of our debt (and) the Federal Reserve has increased its purchase and Federal Reserve credit has subsequently gone up ... in that same period. How serious is this? Is this a major part to your policy, and what happens if in the next year the foreign central banks don't dump just $10 or $15 billion ... what if they dump a whole $100 billion. What kind of pressure does this put on you and what kind of pressure does this put on interest rates, and do they or could they hold us hostage?\"\nGreenspan: \"If central banks decided to sell U.S. Treasury debt the question is somebody else is obviously buying it. So really, what the issue is is a swap, which the central bank switches out of government debt and into other securities, and some other party is doing the opposite. Somebody will be holding our debt; the question really is: Would it significantly affect the price of the debt and the process of that exchange ... would long-term interest rates in the United States go up as a consequence? It is conceivable in a very short-term sense for technical reasons  ... the price of bonds go down and ... interest rates would go up in part.

The growth rate of international trade far exceeds the growth rate of our domestic economy meaning that, on average, we're all importing more than we used to and exporting more and it's pretty clear that that specialization, that globalization has enhanced living standards all over.\nIn the process our trade deficit has opened up as indeed our current account deficit has opened up. It would be a problem for us were it not for the fact that the American dollar is such a preeminent reserve currency and increasingly so. Our rate of inflation, our currency in that sense becomes harder.\nAs that occurs it means that portfolio investments around the world, despite the fact that the current account deficit is pumping additional dollars into the world system as an accounting necessity, that depsite that, the demand for dollars is greater than what is being supplied net.\nSo at the moment, and for the quite foreseeable future, the current account deficit does not appear to be a problem. But current account deficits in and of themselves, if prolonged indefinitely, have the same type of problem that budget deficits have.\nAs you have very large budget deficits your interest payments go up and unless curtailed it's a progressive expansion of the deficit. Well, much the same arithmetic occurs in the current account deficit. That is, interest on foreign investment in the U.S. continues to rise. We've had that for quite a long period of time, our net international liabilities have risen, but it's pretty clear that the levels are small, that the overhang problems are not of considerable concern.\nIt's something which over the longer run will have to be resolved but it doesn't have in it the type short-term problems that the budget deficit created for us and it's something that we will have to address and resolve in the future, but it's not something which I think is an immediately urgent issue in the same sense that the budget deficit was.\"\nRep. Bentsen: In reading your testimony, in where I think you were saying the Fed is at this point is you are not going to make a rate change in near future...the economy is operating at near capacity, unemployment level is extremely low, it is effectively a white hot economy, but you still don't see enough indices that would encourage you to make a rate change. In the future, after Congress adopts a balanced budget agreement and a tax cut as I anticipate they will -- would it be appropriate in the Fed's consideration of the future fed funds rate, discount rate, that you would take into consideration the fact that we are cutting taxes and that we are adding fuel to a possibly overheating economy?\nGreenspan: \"I tried very hard, hopefully successfully, not to indicate what we might or might not do and indeed that's a judgement for the FOMC to make, not for me to make and we will make judgements one way or another depending on what is occuring within the economy at the particular time in which those judgements are made. As I've said in the past when asked if budget deals are made if that will affect monetary policy, I said only to extent that the budget deal itself affects the economy -- we respond to the economy, so I can't say to you that we will react in any particular way depending on the way budget negotiations come out. What we do respond to is what the economy is doing and to the extent that whatever budget deal comes out of the Congress, to the extent that that affects the economy, it's the economy that which we would be responding to, not specific elements of the budget package itself.\"\nRep. Bentsen: \"You would respond if there's a dramatic increase in monetary aggregates or liquidity, that those are factors that the FOMC would consider?\"\nGreenspan: \"Most certainly.\"\nRep. Bentsen: \"In the Fed's most current analysis you state that oil prices have come down from their minor spike in '96 and would appear in the outperiod of this year to be relatively stable. Last week in the Wall Street Journal there was an article that both the U.S. and Germany were looking at selling some of their oil stocks and demand was increasing at a fairly rapid rate. Is that a problem we ought to be concerned about in the long run or is capacity there to deal with that?\"\nGreenspan: \"For the moment what we are observing is production being in excess of consumption worldwide because the level of inventories worlwide is rising. We had a year or so ago exceptionally low inventories and indeed we got down to a level at one point that was quite impressive and there was creating, what they called it then, a just-in-time oil inventory system, and as a consequence the spot prices were selling over the forward prices in the futures market.\nThat's turned all around and inventories are now accumulating, but the world level of production is in excess of consumption and inventories are beginning to move back. We've got reasonably good balance in most of our products.\nIt is true that demand has accelerated, but with the very impressive changes in technology which has enhanced our ability to draw oil out of older wells and to build much higher levels of output outside of conventional OPEC channels, has in my judgement has not created a situation in which we are looking at a need to increase world supply by bringing down government stockpiles.\"\nRep. Bentsen: \"You feel confident that with the backup in inventory, at least for the near term, that we should not see price fluctuation or spike?\"\nGreenspan: \"Oil experts around world are saying the situation is not one in which the immediate notion is inventories are being run down and product prices are rising.

I would therefore, as most economists would, would find it hard to envisage the type of tax credits that are recommended as being in that area. Now there are other reasons why one wants to lower taxes. I would never argue that if it doesn't affect economic growth, that therefore, you shouldn't do it.\"\nRep. Kanjorski: \"Isn't that exactly what some of my colleagues here have been arguing -- that that portion of employed element of our society, the lower two-fifths of our economy, have had the least appreciation of economic distribution of income.\"\nGreenspan: \"That is a fact. That is logical.\"\nRep. Kanjorski: \"Isn't it illogical not to give them the benefit of public tax credit to raise their children ... Isn't there something foolish about limiting that contribution of the general tax public and deny that benefit to people under $35,000 a year income?\"\nGreenspan: \"It is important for the Congress to debate and conclude on this thing, and as a private citizen in this regard, I've got the luxury to sit back and watch.\"\nRep. Kanjorski: \"I think we have a fairly strong economy and I'm very much worried that the consumptive tax that we are putting out there can only exacerbate inflation and maybe you can help by telling me that I'm wrong ...\"\nGreenspan: \"There are a number of economists, reputable economists, who would agree with you.

Should the EC have any authority to determine the outcome of a U.S. domestic market decision that significantly affects employment and do you have concerns about the ability of the EC to intercept electronic wire transfers between U.S. and European companies if the merger goes through and if they disapprove it. Is the Federal Reserve concerned about any of these potential actions?\"\nGreenspan: \"I certainly trust that the presumption that a lot of commentators have put forward that we are on our way to some sort of trade war as a consequence of this dispute, I must say I trust they are mistaken, and that some resolution can be found rather quickly.\nRep. Metcalf: \"Last week when you testified before The Commerce Committee you brought up the issue of capital requirements ... Do you see any changes that need to occur in this provision as the bill makes its way through The Commerce Committee?\"\nGreenspan: \"No. In fact the particular provision which you refer ... is a reasonable sensible one. The technology which I've been discussing here relavent to the economy has had a particularly profound effect of finance, and it's altering the structure of our financial institutions and of necessity, altering the way in which they should or should not be regulated ... The primary base of regulation is the investment bank who is very conscious of what its counterparties' risks are and is very cautious in making investments and loans until it knows what is going. That is the most important root ... of all regulation -- it's private regulation. But, what we do need is -- over the structure of these multinational and multi-state holding companies -- a form of supervision ... We are aware what those organizations do is essentially manage the risk of the total holding company. To the extent that that is what occurs, you need a regulatory oversight at a very modest level which completes the structure of regulation that ... is required because we have a federal safety net which creates and distributes subsidies to the system. So, the specific provision that now exists in this committee's writeup comes reasonable close to that requirement.\"\n","classes":[46,55,56,70],"classes_pad":null}

Operating losses from films had been expected to continue.\nFirst-half group sales climbed five percent to 4.53 billion guilders with music generating sales of 3.94 billion. Operating profit in music rose to 522 million guilders from 457 million during the half.\nThe film division saw first-half turnover dip to 589 million guilders from 681 million with operating losses widening to 92 million from 37 million.\nFilm's second-quarter operating loss was 37 million guilders compared to 55 million in the first quarter and 18 million in the second quarter of 1996.\nChief executive Alain Levy said the strategy at the film unit was on track to deliver break-even over the next two years.\n\"Film strategy is on target. We always said 1997 would be a year of transition. There's nothing there to worry about,\" he said. \"We say 1998-99 for operating profit from film,\" he said reiterating a previous PolyGram forecast.\nPolyGram said the results of its filmed entertainment business reflected the division's lighter release schedule during the first six months of 1997, adding the division expected its strongest releases in the second half.\nThe Dutch company, 75-percent owned by Philips Electronics NV, has recently released \"Bean,\" starring Rowan Atkinson, to enthusiastic audiences in Australia and the Netherlands. It plans to release mainstream movie \"The Game,\" starring Michael Douglas, in September.\nFilm during the first half of 1996 benefited from the success of \"Dead Man Walking,\" \"Fargo,\" and \"Mr Holland's Opus.\"\nAt the first-quarter stage in April PolyGram said underperformance of previously released films \"Portrait of a Lady\" and \"Gridlock'd\" had hit its earnings.\nPolyGram said the combination of sales from established artists such as U2 and the Bee Gees, along with those from breakthrough artists such as Hanson had delivered results in the first half.\n\"Despite challenging conditions in some of our markets, PolyGram's expertise in breaking new acts and promoting established artists is reflected in the first half results,\" Levy said in a statement with results.\nU2 sold over five million copies of their album \"Pop\" in the first half, while the Bee Gees sold 2.3 million albums. Newcomers Hanson -- decades younger than the Bee Gee trio of brothers -- sold three million copies of their album \"Middle of Nowhere\" in the second quarter.\nIn total nine albums sold over one million copies in the first half, compared to 15 in the first six months of 1996 when PolyGram released a bigger number of superstar albums.\nTotal unit sales for the top five albums in the first half of 1997 was 15 million compared to 13 million for the comparable period in 1996.\nAnalysts said the company's performance was broadly as they expected, although the film side had been a little disappointing.\n\"It (the film operation) is loss-making and will remain so for the time being. In the second half there are some good names, but we knew about them already. The prospects are good, but not spectacular,\" said Peter Wortel of Delta Lloyd Bank.\nPolyGram shares closed 90 guilder cents firmer at 101.90 guilders on a sharply higher Amsterdam bourse, back from a session high of 106.10 soon after the results announcement.

Kennedy (D-Mass) -- \"The only way to really determine whether or not the economy is moving strongly is whether or not we have low inflation, which as long as we can have a stock market that is skyrocketing ... the incomes of the wealthiest Americans has skyrocketed ... it creates a situation where working families -- ordinary wage earners -- incomes have stagnated, if not gone down. And if in fact their wages go up, they are immediately put into the inflationary spin and you have to walk in and jack up interest rates, which means they lose their jobs, or certainly they don't get increased wages. If you can, explain to us why you haven't inadvertently pursued a stagnant wage policy.\"\nGreenspan: \"Our long-term purpose is maximum sustainable economic growth. With maximum sustainable economic growth you automatically get the most rapid increase in real wages that is possible.\"\nRep. Kennedy: \"How long have you been chairman?\"\nGreenspan: \"Ten years.\"\nRep. Kennedy: \"Have you seen any wage increase for ordinary working families in those 10 years?\"\nGreenspan: \"The average real wage, if you get the correct price index involved ... there has been a dispersion of income, that is an increase in the degree of inequality in the income distribution, and that arithmetically necessitates that the lower end of your wage trend will be growing more slowly or declining ... that's what dispersion means -- it's the arithmetic equivalent. The true real wage increase has been going up recently, on average.\"\nRep. Kennedy: \"Mr. Chairman, you are talking at cross purposes. You are trying to suggest that because the wealthy have gotten a lot wealthier, that ordinary people have gotten wealthy when in fact these statistics will point to you that ordinary families'... incomes have declined.\"\nGreenspan: \"Let me suggest to you that there is a statistical problem here, which if you want me to discuss with you in great detail I would be glad to do it. But let me complete my answer. First of all, the question really is: What is the reason for wanting financial and price stabiliity. The reason is they do not serve ends in themselves, but history tells us that they are necessary conditions for maximum, sustainable economic growth ... The fact of the matter is, that aggregate real wages move up with overall economic activity, that the share in the national income of compensation of employees has not gone down. It has continued and has maintained ...I'm suggesting to you that consistent with those data on the national accounts, is one: that there is a real income increase in general.\"\nRep.

All we've got is the federal funds rate. With that we can affect the financial system and we can affect long-term economic growth. What we cannot do is affect the distribution of income. That requires other public policies, which I grant you, are things we ought to do. But if you are focusing on monetary policy and stipulating that somehow or in some manner that there are things that can be done with credit creation or the like from the central bank that are going to resolve the issue that you relate to, I say to you: I don't know how to do that.

Paul, (R-Texas) -- \"What if we looked at the prices of stocks as your indicator as you would look at the CRB...or any commodity index...There's a tremendous amount of marking up of prices, a tremendous amount of credit...so instead of being lacking any credit I think we have maybe an excess amount, and I'd like to know if you can reassure us that we have no concerns...that stock prices aren't an indicator that might be similar to a Consumer Price Index?\nA: It is certainly the case that if you look at the structure of long-term nominal government interest rates, that there is still a significant inflation premium left in it. We in the 50's and 60's had much lower nominal rates and the reason was that the inflation rate premium was clearly quite significantly less. I think we'll eventually get back there if we can maintain a stable non-inflationary environment. I don't think we can remove it immediately because it takes a number of years for people to have confidence that you're dealing with a monetary policy which is not periodically inflationary.\nTo follow on the conversation I was having with Congressman Frank, the type of conversation we have at the Federal Open Market Committee is indeed the kind of conversation that's coming from both of you. In other words, we're trying to look at all of these various forces and recoginzing where the stable relationships are and those that tell us about what is very likely to occur in the months, the quarters, and hopefully in the years ahead.\nIt's a very intensive evaluation process, especially during the period when there seems to be changes in the long-term structure, which we do not yet know are significant or overwhelming, but we are experiencing changes which lead us to spend a considerable amount of time trying to evaluate what's going on.\nBut we would be foolish to assume that all of history has been wiped from the slate, and that all of the old relationships, all of the problems we've had in the past have somehow in a period of a relatively few years disappeared.\nThe truth of the matter is that we suspect that there are things that are going on. We don't yet know how important they are. But we are keeping a very close degree of evaluation on all types of events that are occuring, so that we can create what we believe to appropriate monetary policy to keep this economic expansion going in a non-inflationary way because that's what's required to keep both points. Rep Paul-- \"So you're saying the stock price indexes have a lot less value than the commodity price indexes or the Consumer Price Index?\nA: I would say our fundamental purpose is to keep inflation, meaning basically the underlying general price index, stable, because that is the most likely focus which will create financial stability overall. As I've said in previous commentary and discussions before this committee, we have the necessity to look at the whole financial system, but it's always been our conclusion is that the central focus is on stability of product prices as a crucial determinant in the system which if you solve that one, you're likely to solve the others as well.\n","classes":[46,70],"classes_pad":null}

Soy beans have come off a good deal -- they were showing some. Coffee was on its way down. Corn is lower.\nThere is very little agricultural area, obviously, which shows any really significant price pressures. There is also very little as I can see in the industrial area as well. Steel scrap price went up for ... a few weeks and has come back in the last week or so. We've had as close to stable prices that I've seen ... since the 1960s.\"\nRepresentative Lucas: \"How do these commodity prices generally signal inflation pressures ... \"\nGreenspan: \"The early signals of the process, when you begin to see shortages, begin to emerge and you begin to see people starting to trade on those shortages -- it becomes a self-fulfilling process which if fueled by excess credit, engenders inflation ... The extraordinary decline in the price of gold, which incidentally, probably is a small part the result of sales by central banks. What we are seeing is ... increasing sense of the purchasing power of money, currency ... and the implications of that is that inflation expectations generally are falling in the various surveys which have shown very exceptional increases in consumer confidence in the last year or two. We are now beginning also to see a fairly marked decline in long-term inflation expectations in those surveys. So you not only see some evidence, for example, we have a new indexed Treasury security which has some aspects of measuring inflation. Nonetheless, it is showing some evidence which is not inconsistent with one: the decline in the price of gold as a measure of inflation expectations, and two: the number of these surveys which is suggesting that the populace in general is becoming increasingly less fearful of inflation reigniting.\"\n","classes":[46,48,49,70,119,121,123],"classes_pad":null}

It should try to promote it to go faster,\" said Northwestern University Professor of Economics Robert Eisner who will appear on the same panel as James Galbraith, a University of Texas professor.\n\"I have been arguing that it's a very mistaken notion to think that if the economy is doing too well and unemployment is too low, inflation will take off,\" Eisner said.  \n\"It's Main Street as opposed to Wall Street that wants the Fed not to raise rates and allow the economy to be growing more rapidly,\" Eisner added.\nGreenspan indicated on Tuesday that \"basic improvements,\" likely tied to higher productivity, may partly account for the current health of the economy. Analysts said this was the strongest indication yet that the Fed believed some structural changes have taken place in the economy.\nHowever, Greenspan also stated \"I have no doubt that the current stance of monetary policy will need to be changed at some point to foster sustainable growth and low inflation.\"  \nThe Fed chairman is mandated by law to report on the economy and monetary policy to Congress twice a year. Under law, Congress is entitled to call for more hearings on monetary policy to get an array of opinions.\nAFL-CIO Director of Public Policy David Smith said he believed the hearing would highlight inconsistencies in some economic theories used in Fed policy-making, such as the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment or NAIRU.\n\"You can be sure I'll talk about NAIRU and that I do not have very encouraging things to say about that theory,\" Smith said of the notion linking inflation to a jobless rate under 6.0 percent.  \nGordon Richards, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers, said his organization's main concern is that the Fed keeps rates steady.\n\"We can live with interest rates where they are. We would not find it possible with higher interest rates,\" said Richards who will argue the 6.0-percent NAIRU rule no longer apply since \"the inflation rate has been declining over the business cycle along with the unemployment rate.\"\nRichards shared with Greenspan the view productivity is understated, a factor that helped drive inflation lower and thus does not require higher interest rates.\nChase senior economist Jim Glassman said the House hearing on Wednesday was partly motivated by some Congressional discontent at a Fed perceived as overly vigilant. Many Democrats and some Republicans, including House Speaker Newt Gingrich, criticized the Fed for raising the federal funds rate in March, the first tightening in two years.\n\"There are a number of people, mainly Democrats who were complaining about the Fed tightening in March and who were largely critical,\" Glassman said.\nThree Fed officials -- Vice Chair Alice Rivlin, Governor Laurence Meyer and New York Fed President William McDonough -- will be among the 11 panelists testifying before the House. They are expected to echo Greenspan's views.\n(( 212-859-1666))\n","classes":[46,62,63,70,90,100],"classes_pad":null}

Several other committees in the House will consider the measure and the Senate is weighing legislation that would move in the opposite direction.\nRep. Bob Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia and one of the bill's authors, said after the vote he expected the full House to vote on the measure before the end of the year.  \n\"The legislation looks very good,\" Goodlatte told reporters. \"There are other committees that have some peripheral jurisdiction over it and they have until early September to deal with the legislation.\"\n\"Then it's my expectation it will come for a vote on the floor of the House sometime this fall,\" he said.\nThe bill, strongly opposed by the Clinton administration, would allow U.S. companies to export powerful encryption technology, programs which scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software \"key.\"  \nThe administration allows companies to export such programs only if the products allow the government to crack the codes by gaining access to the software keys.\nLawmakers voting for the measure and against the national security exception amendment had to face down top officials from the FBI, National Security Council and Drug Enforcement Agency who attended the vote.\nOpponents of the bill also circulated a last minute written appeal against the bill from Secretary of Defense William Cohen.  \nLaw enforcement officials warned that the use of encryption by criminals would devastate their ability to solve and prevent crimes.\nCommittee chairman Benjamin Gilman, Republican of New York and author of the national security amendment, urged his colleagues to heed those concerns.\n\"We cannot be put in the position here of making mistakes, creating a proliferation of encryption that down the road ties the hands of our law enforcement and intelligence community,\" he said.  \nRep. Sam Gejdenson, Democrat of Connecticut, said the export controls did nothing to prevent criminals from using encryption. He noted that previous unilateral U.S. export controls on computers and machine tools simply allowed foreign companies to gain market share.\n\"Any scoundral, any country that has its interest against the United States can walk into any store in any country and buy encryption software that will give our intelligence boys a heartache,\" Gejdenson said in an impassioned speech. \"The question is whether we're going to make believe we're doing something.\"\nWilliam Reinsch, Under Secretary of Commerce, told lawmakers that approving the bill would also \"cripple\" ongoing negotiations with other countries to impose multilateral export controls.

The content of Greenspan's Senate speech is widely expected to be similar to that of his testimony before the House.\nDuring his speech Tuesday, Greenspan said the Fed may eventually need to change interest rates, but for now economic growth was slowing. \"I have no doubt that the current state of policy ... will need to be changed at some point,\" he said.  \n\"For the present,\" the Fed chairman added, \"demand growth does appear to have moderated.\"\nAnalysts said Greenspan appeared to be content with the current economic scenario, which is one of moderate growth with tight labor markets but no signs of inflationary threats.\n\"(Greenspan) showed absolutely no urgency in changing Fed policy any time soon. That was really the dominant force moving financial markets,\" said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co. Inc.  \nFinancial markets breathed a sigh of relief after Greenspan's speech. Stocks crowned the Chairman's words with a record close of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which surged more than 154 points to 8,061.65 points.\nThe Treasury bond soared more than one and a half points to close at 102-24\/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of prices, dropped to 6.42 percent, the lowest level since Demceber 6, 1996. The dollar was strong.\nPundits said they were happy with Greenspan's apparent positive take on U.S. productivity.  \n\"I think that ... hinted at the direction that Greenspan feels this (economic) cycle is going to be more moderate than other cycles. There is not going to be as much pressure in terms of bottlenecks and strains on capacity,\" Jones said.\nDespite the optimism, analysts did not let Greenspan's words of warning about possible inflation risks pass unheard.\n\"I'm a little bit surprised at the market reaction,\" said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America.  \n\"(Greenspan's speech) seemed to me as though the Fed was still very concerned about a pickup in inflation ... and they are willing to tighten monetary policy if they see any threat that the inflation situation is changing,\" Moran said.\nGreenspan said in his testimony the Fed must be ready to act if necessary to head off excess credit creation.\n\"With considerable momentum behind the expansion and labor market utilization rates unusually high, the Fed must be alert to the possibility that additional action might be called for to forestall excessive credit creation,\" Greenspan said.\nSo if there is to be a new monetary policy tightening this year, when could it take place?\n\"I still think they'll have to tighten, but I don't think it has to be until the fourth quarter, possibly in the November 12 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC),\" Jones said.\nFormer Fed governor Gramley said he still expects the Fed to tighten rates twice later in 1997, adding that he sees the federal funds rate at 6.0 percent by year end.\nThe Fed last changed monetary policy on March 25, when it raised the fed funds rate by 25 basis points to 5.50 percent.

Revenues jumped to $24.5 million compared to $9.8 million in the same period last year.\nIn May, Citrix signed a licensing deal with Microsoft Corp, that will bring in to Citrix an initial $75 million in fees and up to $100 million in royalties.\nJames Felcyn, Citrix's chief financial officer, said that the income from the deal is pro-rated and that only about 10 percent of the revenue recorded in the second quarter came from Microsoft.\n\"The Microsoft component, pro-rated in, was about $2.1 million,\" he said, adding that virtually all of the company's growth in the period was from sales of its packaged software.\nCitrix writes software that lets an old PC or an outdated terminal -- a type of computer that gets its computing power from a corporate network -- run programs written for Microsoft's Windows. The deal involves technology which would let several terminal using Windows NT use a single server for running common business software.\nThe two companies will also co-market future products.\nCitrix has also recently announced a licensing agreement with Amdahl Corp and a marketing pact with 3Com Corp .\nWhile neither Citrix executive would make projections about future earnings, Iacobucci said he is \"cautiously optimistic,\" and notes that the company's current business model should produce stable growth.\n\"It's strong steady growth,\" he said. \"It (the software) is a solution that is needed, regardless of whatever is on the horizon, and I think with (the deal with) Microsoft it's just taking away some concerns that were on the horizon.\"\nShares of Citrix fell 2-5\/8 to 52-5\/8 in active trade on Tuesday.\n","classes":[15,16,44],"classes_pad":null}

The market observer said that the coming sessions likely will have investors restructuring their portfolios to lengthen duration and preserve convexity.\nThe move down in coupon has been prompted by fears that higher-coupon loans will be prepaid as homeowners refinance in an environment of lower interest rates.\nShould the Treasury's 10-year note yield break through 6.0-percent, mortgages likely will widen 10 to 15 basis points, according to Michael Youngblood, managing director of mortgage research at Chase Securities Inc.\nYoungblood noted that 7.5 percent coupons and 8.0 percent coupons originated between 1994 and 1996 will probably see heightened prepayment activity.\nInna Koren, first vice president at Prudential Securities, agreed that activity mortgage-backeds this afternoon was subdued. Much of the movement down in coupon, she said, was evident in within the last few weeks.\nShould the 10-year Treasury note plunge below 6.0-percent, Koren expects mortgages to widen five to 10 basis points.\nLate in the session, GNMA 7.5 percent coupons were up 20\/32 at 101 22\/32 to offer a bond equivalent yield of 7.275. Federal National Mortgage Association 7.5 percent coupons were up 16\/32 at 101 17\/32 and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp 7.5 percent coupons were up 17\/32 at 101 23\/32.\nMeanwhile, the Treasury's 10-year note was up 32\/32 at 103 20\/32 to yield 6.13.\n(( --Aleksandrs Rozens, U.S. Mortgage Unit, 212-859-1668 ))\n","classes":[115,123],"classes_pad":null}

Six-month rates fell two basis points to 5.15 percent and year-bill rates fell six basis points to 5.23 percent.\nThe five-year note jumped 17\/32 to 100-27\/32 to yield 6.05 percent.

Second-month December eased $3 on the day, to $1,549, while the back months finished down $5.\nA flurry of long liquidation by speculators and trade selling pressured prices from the opening bell, after a decline on the London cocoa market overnight. New York cocoa prices fell nearly $20 to new six-week lows before manufacturer buying emerged to stem the slide, dealers said.\nWhile some traders said the market could be in for a further decline, other traders noted today's recovery was constructive.\n\"It could take another drop, but it only ended $2 lower and it didn't fall apart,\" said one trader. \"I think the specs have dumped enough longs and could come in buying in the near-term.\"\nTechnically, dealers pegged September support at today's low of $1,485, followed by $1,475. On the upside, they said September would face some resistance at $1,510, with the next level seen at a chart gap between $1,521 and $1,525.\nOn the fundamental side, UK-based analyst Robert Fish of Primary Commodities Research told Reuters on Tuesday that Africa's 1997\/98 (Oct-Sept) cocoa crops could feel the impact of dry El Nino weather forecast for late 1997, but overall output may not be affected due to a trend of rising production.\nIn other news, upcountry cocoa buyers in the Ivory Coast said on Tuesday that the quality of 1996\/97 mid-crop (May-Sept) is improving and rising harvests should soon swell the thin volumes arriving at ports since May.\nAlthough volume was fairly heavy at an estimated 9,033 lots, traders said much of the activity occurred in the first hours of trading. They said market was relatively quiet for most of the afternoon.\n\"It was a decent range, but there was nothing to get excited about,\" said a trader. \"Once the first hour was over, that was it.\"\n((--Patricia Avidan, New York Commodity Desk +1 212 859 1640))\n","classes":[119,120,123],"classes_pad":null}

The content of Greenspan's Senate speech is widely expected to be similar to that of the House's.\nAnalysts said that with the lack of any fresh economic data, market players will also pay close attention to the Treasury sale of $11.5 billion in five-year notes.  \n\"I think demand will be there for the five-year notes,\" said a trader at a primary dealership here.\nOn Tuesday, the Treasury placed some $15.5 billion in two-year notes. The securities were placed with yields of 5.93 percent. The auction had a 2.53 bid-to-cover ratio. Demand was considered \"decent\" by traders.\nAnalysts said the U.S. yield curve appears to be properly priced for the current economic outlook, which is that of sustained growth combined with tight labor markets but no major inflationary threats.  \nThe two-year note yield, for example, is currently trading around 5.85 percent against the 5.50 percent federal funds rate set by the Federal Reserve.\nAnalysts said that spread -- which has been hovering around 35 and 40 basis points -- is tight and unlikely to narrow much further unless there is a change in sentiment on the market's overall perception of the economy.\n\"As long as the Fed is holding to a steady policy, the yields may not come down a lot more compared to what we have seen,\" said Gary Thayer, senior economist at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc.  \nBut are people really talking about the possibility of an easing of monetary policy?\n\"We have seen the gold start to bounce and crude oil has stabilized, so I think we have to see another wash out in commodity prices for the Fed to feel at all comfortable with taking back their rate hike in March.\n\"The markets would like to see (an easing) -- that's the reason why the yields on the two-year notes are so tight to fed funds -- but I just don't expect it,\" Thayer said.\nThe Fed last changed monetary policy on March 25, when it raised the fed funds rate to 5.50 percent by 25 basis points.  \nThe central bank stood pat at the May and July meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nSome analysts said, however, there might be some interesting plays in the long end of the yield curve even if the shorter maturies remain locked in a range.\n\"Spreads are very, very tight, no question about that,\" said Kathleen Stephansen, senior economist at Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp.\n\"But I think the market can stay there for a while and my sense is that the play is going to be in the longer end,\" the economist added.\nThe 6.625-percent benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was quoted up 1-18\/32 at 102-21\/32 in late trading on Tuesday. Its yield was at 6.42 percent, the lowest since the close on December 5, 1996.\nAnalysts said they expect the federal funds rate to open around 5.44 percent on Wednesday.\n(( -- N.A.

{"codes":["M14","M141","MCAT"],"headline":"CSCE coffee ends up sharply, September surges.","text":"\nCSCE coffee futures posted strong gains on Tuesday, led by a surge in the September contract, as speculators and the trade bought heavily on fears of a shortage of exchange-certified coffee for delivery against the September contract, dealers said.\nBenchmark September shot up to an intraday peak of 170.50 cents per lb, its highest level in over a week, before light profit-taking trimmed gains. By the close, September stood at 169.10 cents, up 10.25 cents -- or more than six percent -- on the day.\nSecond-position December rose 5.00 cents, to 151.25 cents, while the back months closed 4.00 to 6.00 higher.\nThe September\/December switch, a barometer of nearby availability, ballooned to 17.35 cents compared with 12.90 cents at the close on Monday.\nTraders attributed the buying to a potential lack of certified coffee against the September open position after U.S. trade house Cargill \"stopped\" a large amount of coffee certified for delivery against July.\nIn a July delivery notice summary put out by CSCE following today's final notices, the exchange said Cargill had stopped 252 lots out of a total of 269 lots stopped. The data also showed that Cargill issued 21 lots.\nWith stoppers minus the issued notices, traders said Cargill still stopped or owned 231 lots of certified coffee, the equivalent of over 65,000 60-kg bags and the majority of the CSCE's certified stockpile as of July 18 of 86,849 bags.\nWith little certifiable coffee expected to make its way to the exchange ahead of the autumn harvest of many new-crop Latin American coffees, some dealers feared a tightening of certified stocks going into September delivery. September's first notice day is only about a month away, on August 21.\n\"People are wondering if Cargill is going to squeeze September because they have the bulk of the certified coffee,\" said one trader. \"I don't want to be short because they can potentially squeeze it, and looking ahead, supplies will be tight for September delivery with no new-crop certifieds available ahead of the harvest.\"\nAfter Tuesday's close, CSCE reported that certified coffee inventories rose by 382 60-kg bags as of July 21, to 87,231 bags. An additional 4,859 bags were pending grading, the exchange said.\n\"There is still less than 100,000 (60-kg bags) of certified coffee, which is still tight,\" said Merrill Lynch analyst Judith Ganes. \"And there is only going to be minimal shipments from here out.\"\nTraders also said today's rally was helped by the charts, with September taking off after piercing 165.00-166.00 cents per lb resistance and touching off buy-stops.\nIn the near-term, traders pegged September resistance at 172.00 cents, while September support was seen near 165.00 cents.\nTurnover on the day moderate, at an estimated 7,462 lots.\n((--Patricia Avidan, New York Commodity Desk +1 212 859 1640))\n","classes":[119,120,123],"classes_pad":null}

The latter two levels roughly correspond to September marks at 0.5472 and $0.5431, respectively.\nYen, however, gained ground partly on crosses, with some brokers saying action suggested players who had bailed out of long yen\/short mark positions may have reset those spreads.  \nMarks languished under continued talk of a broad-based and therefore weak start for European monetary union. Overnight, Bundesbank council member Hans-Juergen Koebnick said the euro could be stable even if Germany and France had deficits of 3.2 to 3.3 percent of gross domestic product.\nTraders said daily volume was generally moderate, although mark action picked up late as dealers and funds sold size.\nSept yen rose $0.000062 to $0.008741, marks lost $0.0087 to $0.5502, Swiss francs lost $0.0036 to $0.6788, sterling rose $0.0004 to $1.6758, Can dollar rose $0.0001 to $0.7286, Aus dollar lost $0.0027 to $0.7400, Mex peso rose $0.000975 to $0.124950.

He also said the Federal Open Market Committee was confident of modest 1997 inflation but sees a rise in 1998.\nShort-covering, technical strength and a positive two-year note auction aided the buoyant afternoon tone, said Don Pullen, bond trading floor manager for E.D. and F.

Corporate tax payments jumped to $39.73 billion in June from $4.25 billion a month earlier.  \nSo far in this fiscal year, government outlays totaled $1.202 trillion against revenues of $1.192 trillion. At this point in 1996, outlays totaled $1.165 trillion and revenues totaled $1.091 trillion.\nThe June budget surplus exceeded the expectations of most Wall Street economists, but was in line with the $54 billion surplus predicted by the Congressional Budget Office in an analysis dated July 9 and issued on July 17.  \nWall Street economists expect the budget deficit for all of fiscal 1997, which ends on Sept. 30, to fall to about $50 billion from a deficit of $106.99 billion in fiscal 1996.\nThe Clinton administration has forecast a deficit for all of fiscal 1997 of $125.59 billion, but it is expected to issue a revised forecast later this year.\nMany economists have predicted that higher-than-expected revenues generated by the nation's strong economy could wipe out the deficit completely by the end of next year, calling into question the need for the budget-balancing agreement that is now being negotiated between Congress and the White House.\nWhite House Budget Director Franklin Raines called the idea of letting the budget balance itself without a five-year agreement \"absurd.\"\nThe last time the United States posted a budget surplus was 1969.\n","classes":[55,56,70,90,104],"classes_pad":null}

{"codes":["M11","MCAT"],"headline":"US OPTIONS FOCUS\/Informix calls heavily traded.","text":"\nVolume in Informix Corp call options ballooned and implied volatilities soared as a conference the company was holding in California created a variety of speculation, traders said.\nInformix August 12.5 calls were the most active contract on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), with more than 8,800 contracts changing hands by 1230 CDT\/1730 GMT.\nSeptember 12.5 calls and August 10.0 calls had turnover of more than 4,700, and the August 12.5 calls also traded heavily on the American Stock Exchange (AMEX).\nThe stock was up 1-1\/16 at 10-3\/4, also on hefty volume.  \nThe surge in interest stemmed from a big user conference which Informix, a database technology firm, was holding in San Francisco, said strategist Paul Foster of Mercury Trading, a market-making firm at CBOE handling Informix options.\n\"It creates excitement when you have 6,000 programmers and users,\" he said. \"Obviously, there are some money managers there.\"\nTraders said talks and rumors driving up interest ranged from possible management changes, takeovers, earnings and future products.  \n\"It's nothing specific,\" Foster said. \"Implied volatilities have spiked up on anxiety over what actually is going on because I don't think anyone really knows what the issues are.\"\nImplied volatility for the August 12.5 calls shot up to about 110 percent from usual levels near 70 percent.\nHarrison Roth, first vice president of Cowen & Co, said the call buying looked mostly outright, not boosted by spreads.\nFoster said the order flow was coming in from a \"mixture of paper (retail customers)\".  \nTime-and-sale figures showed that most orders came in small lots, indicating the public was buying, after a few large institutionals-size orders early in the session, said Michael Schwartz, a managing director of Oppenheimer & Co.\nHe noted that when implied volatilities were bid up in such a way, market makers tended to have an upper hand because volatilities would shrink after the speculative interest dried up, making it difficult for premiums to appreciate.\nStill, most traders said the stock looked positive technically as it has broken out of a 1-1\/2 month range between 8-1\/2 and 10.  \nElsewhere, International Business Machines Corp options saw heavy volume again after the company released its earnings late Monday.\nInterestingly, Schwartz said, implied volatilities shrank drastically despite a pullback in the stock price. Thus, premium on August 100 puts, the vehicle of choice for stockholders hedging against a decline, was down 1 at 3-1\/2.\n\"It didn't make sense to buy the puts yesterday,\" he said.\nJay Shartsis, director of options trading at R.F. Lafferty & Co, said the reaction probably meant the stock has put in a near-term bottom.

It involves one hospital and billing for one particular procedure. It's a very focused and specific situation that we've been working on with the (attorney general's) office for a while now. That's nothing new. Nor is it at all connected to the stuff that unfolded last week,\" Hutcherson said.  \nColumbia\/HCA is the target of a federal probe expected by industry analysts to continue into 1998. The company confirmed last week that federal agents seized billing and other business records from Columbia\/HCA facilities in six states -- Texas, Florida, Tennessee, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Utah.\nIn Texas, Hutcherson said, the state attorney general inquired two years ago about business practices at one hospital. \"There have been some more questions about that in the last six months in that case,\" she said. \"Again, that involved only one hospital, but certainly not anything of the scope that's referred to in this morning's article.\"  \nThe Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the Texas attorney general has launched an investigation of potential Medicaid abuses at an unspecified number of Columbia\/HCA hospitals. The newspaper also reported that the Alabama attorney general was pursuing a criminal investigation of possible Medicaid abuses at a Columbia\/HCA hospital.\nIn Texas, Attorney General Dan Morales has opened an investigation into billing practices at the company's operations, a spokesman said. \"We do have an investigation, we are looking into Columbia\/HCA. I cannot go beyond that,\" spokesman Ron Dusek said.\nAn Alabama attorney general's office spokesman declined to confirm or deny existence of any investigation.\nColumbia\/HCA's Hutcherson said she was not personally aware of any other state-level investigations of the company, but she said it was possible there could be other actions.\nShe said the general thrust of the investigations is along the lines the company outlined last week. \"The documents they've requested relate to ... hospital laboratory billing and home health operations.

The company reported its second quarter 1997 earnings last week, noting Zocor sales jumped 25 percent to $865 million during the quarter.  \nMerck's shares treaded negative territory most of the day but edged up 1\/4 to 105 midafternoon Tuesday -- restrained by the SmithKline news, analysts said.\nTwo other U.S.-based companies, American Home Products Corp and Schering-Plough Corp, meanwhile saw their shares rise Tuesday following their release earlier in the day of cheerful earnings results.\nAmerican Home Products was up 1-5\/16 to 79-3\/4.  It said earnings per share for the 1997 second quarter rose 15 percent to $0.71, matching the First Call consensus estimate.  \nSchering-Plough was up 1-1\/4 to 50.  Its $0.51 earnings-per share figure for the 1997 second quarter was one cent above First Call projections, with year-on-year net earnings rising 18 percent.\nWarner-Lambert had reported earnings per share of $0.85 in the recent second quarter, leapfrogging the First Call estimate of $0.81.  Sales rose 10 percent, led by Lipitor's $151 million contribution.\nBristol-Myers said its 1997 second quarter earnings per share rose 14 percent to $0.74, matching the First Call consensus estimate.\n(( Ransdell Pierson, New York Newsdesk, 212 859-1736))\n","classes":[15,16,18,44],"classes_pad":null}

In the year-ago period Rockwell had operating earnings, before special charges, of $0.88 a share.  \nThe company said it expects fiscal 1997 earnings per share to be about 12 percent above 1996 levels. Rockwell had previously set a goal of 15 percent earnings growth year-over-year.\n\"For our fiscal fourth quarter, we see a continuing earnings pattern by our businesses -- very strong performances by Automation and Avionics & Communications partially offset by lower Semiconductor Systems earnings compared to last year,\" said Chairman and Chief Executive Don Beall.\nBeall said the company's Semiconductor Systems unit will see sequential growth compared with the third quarter.  \n\"We expect our fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations will be about equal to last year and our full year 1997 earnings per share will be about 12 percent over 1996, excluding special acquisition-related charges,\" Beall said.\nRockwell Tuesday reported earnings of $167 million, or $0.79 a share, on revenues of $1.93 billion compared to profits of $223 million, or $1.02 a share, on revenues of $1.89 billion.  \nThird quarter earnings include a charge of $19 million, or $0.09 a share, from the acquisition of the Hi-Media broadband communication chipset business of ComStream Corp. Including this charge, income from continuing operations for the third quarter was $131 million, or $0.62 a share. Third quarter results also included an $18 million gain on the sale of property offset by a $13 million charge for environmental costs expected to be incurred at a previously-owned facility.\nThird quarter earnings per share from continuing operations before an acquisition-related special charge was $0.71 compared to $0.67 a year ago. These earnings exclude the Automotive business, which was reported as discontinued operations.\nIn the third quarter Rockwell's Automation business, which accounted for 59 percent of sales, had a 10 percent earnings increase over 1996 and Avionics & Communications earnings grew by 41 percent. Earnings at Semiconductor Systems were lower due to the transition to the new high-speed K56flex computer modem which caused price reductions on older modems.\nTo date Rockwell has shipped nearly four million K56flex modem chipsets to customers.\n","classes":[15,18,44],"classes_pad":null}

Our twelve-month-to-date return on capital employed averaged 13.4 percent,\" said chairman and chief executive Laurance Fuller in a statement.  \nU.S. E&P operations earned $209 million in the second quarter compared with $234 million in the prior-year period. \"The decrease primarily resulted from lower crude oil prices and lower crude oil and natural gas production. Partly offsetting were lower exploration expenses and higher natural gas prices,\" the company said.\nAmoco's second quarter U.S. natural gas prices averaged about $1.70 per thousand cubic feet, or mcf, an increase of three percent over the comparable period of 1996. Amoco's average U.S. crude oil prices of about $17.60 per barrel declined $1.90 per barrel from the second quarter of 1996.  \n\"Second-quarter 1997 natural gas and crude oil production decreased compared with the prior-year quarter, due to normal field declines and dispositions,\" Amoco said.\nCanadian E&P operations reported earnings of $22 million in the second quarter compared with restated 1996 quarterly earnings of $26 million. \"The slight decrease in 1997 earnings primarily reflected lower crude oil prices and lower natural gas production, which more than offset lower exploration expenses and higher natural gas prices,\" the company said.  \nCanadian earnings for 1996 were restated to reflect the transfer of Canadian supply and marketing operations for crude oil, sulfur, and NGL to the petroleum products sector.\nOverseas E&P operations earned $67 million in the second quarter compared with $85 million a year ago. \"The decline was primarily due to lower crude oil prices and higher exploration expenses,\" the company said.  \nPetroleum products operations earned $185 million during the second quarter, versus restated earnings of $119 million in the second quarter of 1996, which were restated to reflect the transfer of Canadian supply and marketing operations for crude oil, sulfur, and NGL to petroleum products.\nIn the second quarter, U.S. refined product sales totaled 1.218 million barrels per day compared with 1.211 million barrels per day a year ago. Refineries ran at 95 percent of rated capacity, compared with 97 percent a year earlier.\nChemical earnings of $185 million for the second quarter of 1997 compared with earnings of $173 million for the similar 1996 period.\nOverall, Amoco reported second quarter earnings of $622 million, an increase of $22 million over the second quarter of 1996. Second quarter earnings per share of $1.26 were up five percent over the comparable 1996 period.\nIn the first six months of 1997, 6.9 million shares of common stock, in excess of amounts needed for benefit plan purposes, were repurchased at a cost of $602 million as part of a previously announced $2 billion, two-year common stock repurchase program, Amoco said.\n((--Chicago Newsdesk 312-408-8787))\n","classes":[15,16,44],"classes_pad":null}

The stock had earlier risen to 78 in pre-market trade from the unofficial close of 77-1\/4 after reporting earnings of $0.44 per share, or $0.03 above the First Call consensus estimate.  \nOn April 23, Symantec Corp said it had filed a lawsuit in Santa Clara County, alleging McAfee \"knowingly pirated vital software code\" and had incorporated it into McAfee products.\nSpecifically, Symantec said it was accusing McAfee of stealing code from Norton CrashGuard, a computer crash protection and recovery program, and incorporating it into McAfee's PC Medic product. On Monday, it said it had filed a motion to amend its copyright infringement complaint.\nSymantec charged that McAfee had used additional code allegedly copied from Symantec in McAfee products, including software packages VirusScan and PC Medic 97.  \nSymantec said in its statement Monday it also had filed a supplemental motion for a preliminary injunction based on fresh allegations of newly discovered copying.\nSymantec said it plans to request during a hearing for preliminary injunction scheduled for August 29 that the court stop shipment of McAfee products Symantec alleges to contain infringing code and remove the products from sales channels.\nMcAfee said it denied all allegations Symantec made in the statement and has broken off discussions with Symantec until further notice.  McAfee said it will file a contempt of court motion against Symantec for negotiating in bad faith.  \nAnalysts said the Symantec statement appeared to be timed to hit McAfee hardest, coming just before an upbeat quarterly report and a week after the company said it had unveiled its VirusScan product to protect computer users from viruses and hostile attacks from across the Internet global network.\n\"I haven't found that people who have owned the (McAfee) stock for a long time are as concerned about it, but the whole juxtaposition of all these issues seems to be getting worse,\" said one Wall Street analyst.  \"I think the competitive issues look worse than they really are...They're on a roll with products.  They're getting more contracts that are out there.\"  \nMcAfee, based in Santa Clara, said it will sue for alleged defamation and business interference, seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.\nSources familiar with the case said it involves developers moving between the companies and while an independent analysis found specific lines of code that were identical between the two products, it could also reflect a programmer's habits.\n\"I don't think you can prove malicious intent,\" one said.\nAnalysts said McAfee continues to provide strong results.\nAlex. Brown analyst Mary McCaffrey said she has a strong buy on McAfee and has raised earnings per share estimates to $1.73 from $1.64 for 1997 and to $2.45 from $2.40 from 1998.\nMcAfee said company executives told analysts that days of sales outstanding, which rose to the 62 day level from around 44 in the first quarter, would likely remain at the higher end of the range due to more international business and larger contracts and could dip somewhat from these levels next year.\n((-sam.perry@reuters.com, in Palo Alto, +1 415 846 5400))\n","classes":[12,13,44,90,91],"classes_pad":null}

It could go either way, but we feel very strong that the judge will rule in our favour,\" Johnson's agent, Morris Chrobotek, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday.\n\"We look forward to a green light and Ben immediately coming back and proving to the world that he still has it in him,\" Chrobotek said.\nJohnson became the centre of the sport's most infamous doping scandal after he won the 100 meters gold medal at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, clocking a record 9.79 seconds.\nShortly after his spectacular victory, Johnson tested positive for anabolic steroids in Seoul. He was stripped of his medal and his world record was struck from the books.\nJohnson was banned from competition for two years, and at an official Canadian inquiry into drugs in sport that followed the scandal, he admitted to many years of illegal steroid use.\nIn 1993, Johnson was banned for life after a test found high levels of testerone in his system. He has denied using an illegal substance and his lawyers argued that the IAAF, which governs international athletics, did not give their client a fair hearing and denied his right to work.\nJohnson has tried his hand at other sports over the past four years, but met with little success. The money he earned as one of the world's elite runners is dwindling.\n\"I do what I do best (which) is run and hopefully the judge will rule on that,\" Johnson told reporters after leaving the court room on Monday.\nJohnson's lawyers have been encouraged by past IAAF statements that it was willing to follow the rule of local jurisdictions. They hope the ban will be lifted if Caswell agrees that Johnson's right to earn a living had been violated.\nAthletics Canada lawyers have argued the sports body has done nothing to prevent Johnson from earning a living.\nThey contend most of Johnson's earnings did not come from competitive events, but from endorsements which dried up after 1988.\nJohnson's case has divided opinion within Canada's athletics community. Current Olympic sprint champion Donovan Bailey has said Johnson should not be allowed to race again.\nOthers suggest Johnson will get a favourable ruling Friday based on precedents set in other countries where lengthy suspensions were overturned as a result of right-to-work arguments.\n\"If the judge favours Johnson, then it will put pressure on the IAAF. If the courts are constantly overturning these rules then you have to question the validity of these rules,\" Cecil Smith, executive director of the Ontario Track and Field Association, said on Tuesday.\n","classes":[90,108],"classes_pad":null}

How this is going to make a difference in my life and all the fun things I'm going to get to do.\" he said. \"It still hasn't sunk in yet, but I'm feeling really good.\"\nLeonard said he only got to sleep 90 minutes in his hotel room before getting on the plane to return to Dallas.\nAfter the brief airport ceremony, he took a police escort to travel to his home club, Royal Oaks Country Club in northeast Dallas. It was at Royal Oaks where Leonard took his first formal lesson from head pro Randy Smith and the two have remained together for the last 14 years.\n\"There was a lot of emotion when he won,\" Smith said. \"A lot of tears were shed.\"\nIt was tears of joy for some 1,000 Royal Oak members were lined the staircase of the club and crowded into a large ballroom to welcome Leonard home.\n\"The sign here says we, 'Love you Justin and we love you a lot, you have made his very proud,\" club president Bob Law said.\nAlso at the party was golf legend Byron Nelson and Dallas mayor Ron Kirk, who proclaimed Monday, July 21 as Justin Leonard Day in the City of Dallas.\nNelson joked he just wanted to come over and see a British Open champion in person.\n\"I had a lot of friends who have won British Opens and this man will win more than one\" Nelson said, pointing to Leonard.\nAfter the brief speech, Leonard hugged Nelson and let him hold the silver Open trophy.\nWhile the Royal Oaks ballroom was filled with well-wishers on Monday, it was much calmer than the rowdy, supportive members who gathered early Sunday to watch Leonard capture his first major championship.\nCourse officials broadcast continual updates over the loudspeakers, and when Leonard rolled in his 30-foot birdie putt to take the lead on the par-4 17th hole, most golfers abandoned their own games to come in and watch the final historic steps for Leonard.\nThe aftermath was shirt racks turned over, paper and scorecard littering the floor, and Leonard signs hanging over the clubhouse.\n\"I don't think anybody got anything done, but that's OK, because we were all watching one of our own do good,\" Smith said.\nLeonard thanked the Royal Oaks members at the late Monday night party for their support and encouragement.\n\"I've achieved some goals I set for myself, maybe a little earlier than I thought I would. Now I guess I have to set my goals a little higher.\"\nAfter a couple of days of rest and refreshment, Leonard said he would begin to prepare for the PGA Championship in New York next month and the Ryder Cup matches in Spain in September.\n\"My next goal is to help us win back the Ryder Cup,\" Leonard said.\nHe became the first Dallas resident to win the British Open trophy since Lee Trevino did it in 1971-72. He is the fourth Texan to win, joining Ben Hogan, Bill Rogers and Trevino.\nLeonard's win was even enough to knock the football Dallas Cowboys off the front page of the sports section, quite a feat in football-crazy Texas.\n\"He's still on a high and so are we,\" said Larry Leonard, Justin's father.\n","classes":[90,108],"classes_pad":null}

{"codes":["E41","ECAT","GCAT","GJOB"],"headline":"OPINION - S.AFRICA'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE - BY E.OSBORN.","text":"\nBy Edward Osborn, consultant to Edey, Rogers (Pty) Ltd\nA perennial, but inadequately answerable, question is what is the rate of unemployment in South Africa, where there is no formal system of unemployment registration and no system of social support of general application.\nThere are also blurring aspects of the problem arising from not insignificant numbers of adults that may be engaged in sustaining activities not associated with paid employment, such as subsistence agriculture. Such people should be regarded as in employment.\nSome precision is put on the concepts by the Central Statistical Service (CSS).\nThey identify the population that is over the age of 15 and subdivide this into two broad categories of non-economically active and workers. Workers, in turn, are subdivided into the employed, whether for a wage, salary, or profit or for gamily gain, and those unemployed.\nHowever, the definition of unemployment is not without its problems. A strict definition requires the worker to have taken active steps to obtain work or undertake self employment. The looser or expanded definition simply identifies the unemployed as desirous of working.\nThis is the definition now used by the CSS and is clearly more appropriate to South African conditions where the number of job opportunities are limited and finding work is very frustrating. It is significant that, according to the 1995 October Household Survey, 69 percent of the unemployed had no previous occupation.\nThe difference between the strict and relaxed definition, too, is very significant in that there were an estimated 2.2 million who were not looking for work but were prepared to do so.\nThe October Household Surveys in 1994 and 1995 use the same definitions but give different assessments of the unemployment rates, although they are in the same ballpark, as it were. The 1994 survey puts it at 32.6 percent and the 1995 survey at 29.3 percent.\nAt first glance this might be construed as reflecting an improvement in the employment situation from 1994 to 1995, particularly as it coincided with the major phase of the economic upswing. However, there are such disparate results in the composition of the populations in the two surveys that the reason for the different rates must be more largely statistical. Differenct methodologies were used in drawing the samples and, of course, the samples were different. The CSS notes that they are essentially separate snapshots during two consecutive years.\nFor example, while the total estimated population of South Africa between the two years grew by 2.2 percent, the population over the age of 15 grew by 2.9 percent, the non economically active population by 5.4 percent and the worker population by only 0.4 percent. The small 59,000 net addition to the working population was ostensibly made up of 511,000 more in employment and 452,000 less in unemployment. As with most sample survey analysis the comparisons to the finer subdivisions do not stand up to scrutiny.\nHowever, a structure or model of the economic involvement of the working population is roughly evident from the two censuses, namely that there was an average adult population of 63.4 percent of the total population and that 45 percent of these were not economically active. Of the economically active 69 percent were employed and 31 percent unemployed. Thus the unemployment rate established by these two surveys, which were sufficiently compatible in statistical terms, was of the order of 30 percent.\nHowever, this result is in the context of a total population of about 41 million. As is well known the preliminary census results for 1996 surprisingly came up with a total population of 37.9 million, which the Census Evaluation Committee adjudged unlikely to be revised upwards by more than two percent i.e. a maximum population total of 38.6 million. What could this possibly imply for the unemployment rate?\nOne could start with the likelihood that the age distribution of the earlier surveys was reliable and that the higher adult proportion of the 1995 survey is the better of the two because of the conviction that has emerged from the preliminary census results that the birth rates assumed in the 1991 census were overstated. Thus at 63.65 percent from the 1995 survey, the adult population would be 24.1 million. This comprises the three elements of non-economically active, the employed and the unemployed, with the respective possible combinations being infinite.\nHowever, it does appear that the estimates of employed in the surveys, particularly the 1994 one, are roughly correct as ballpark numbers. In the 1994 survey total employed were 9.64 million, which is roughly reconcilable with formal sector employees of 5.3 million, formal agriculture employment of 1.1 million, the informal sector of 1.7 million, domestic workers of some 1.1 million, and 0.5 million for the self-employed in the formal sector totalling 9.7 million. The figures are taken from various sources.\nInasmuch as there has been no significant shift in the formal sector employment numbers between 1994 and 1996 - actually the trend has been marginally downward -- the 1994 figure of 9.6 million could thus be the appropriate figure to take for the employed, leaving 14.5 million for the non-economically active and the unemployed. Again the split is indeterminate unless, impressionistically, we resort to the 1995 survey result of 45.7 percent of the adult population being the non-economically active. This would then end up with the result that 11.0 million were not active and 3.5 million unemployed. And the implied rate of unemployement would be 26.7 percent.\nHowever, after mulling over the figures one must conclude that this is the lower extreme of the possible results and a fair conclusion would be that the minimum unemployment rate is 27 percent. Until the full census results come out next April we would have to be content with a rough and ready statement that unemployment lies somewhere between 27 percent and 30 percent, centred on about 3.7 million people, which still remains an awful lot.\n\t\t\t\t  \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/\n(The opinions expressed in this article represent those of the author only.

It is one of the countries biggest foreign exchange earners.\nThe U.N.'s World Food Programme (WFP) said it feared repercussions of drought next year due to the El Nino weather phenomena.\nDom Scalpelli, WFP project officer, said a second minor crop in August will give a clearer idea of production.\nTrade has boomed in Mozambique since the Frelimo-led government and former rebel Renamo signed a peace pact in 1992 to end a 16-year civil war, followed by elections in 1994.\nPeace and liberalisation of the economy has increased business confidence.\nFamilies are currently cultivating on average just over a hectare of land and Western aid officials, working in the countryside, say many are realising the impact of the new open market.\n\"People have never been encouraged to sell before, but they are now finding there is a market,\" one official said.\nThe WFP said, however, the increase in food production since last year was more due to favourable weather conditions and political stability than to the impact of reforms in the sector.\nSome aid officials says the arrival of the first 13 South African farmers who have been granted rights on a former state farm in the northern province of Niassa is also key to development.\n\"What the country needs is the little push that the South African farmers will give the sector,\" one official said.\nData from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development shows that total area planted increased by six percent in 1996-97 to 3,627,000 hectares, but heavy rains had damaged about 130,000 heactares of food crops, including 45,000 heactares of maize along the rivers in some central and southern provinces.\nThe WFP says that just four percent of total area of agriculture land is presently cultivated. The agriculture sector employs over 80 percent of labour force with employment in non-farms sectors very limited.\nThe issue of land tenure, currently being debated in parliament, which will appropriate land to individuals, companies and communities, is seen as necessray to build confidence among farmers working on state land.\n\"Mozmabique is very close to food sufficincy, which will allow people to survive, but it won't make them develop,\" one aid official said.\n-- Johannesburg newsroom +27 11 482 1003\n","classes":[13,32,33,44,46,70],"classes_pad":null}

But local officials said only one district was in grave danger.\nThe earlier Odra wave was at last approaching the sea, lapping ominously at some areas near the port city of Szczecin.\nElsewhere, citizens and tens of thousands of troops worked shoring up sandbag barriers to contain local flood emergencies.\nPoland's cabinet met on Tuesday to make final decisions on its major three-phase reconstruction plan.\nThis involves fast relief to victims and disease prevention measures, medium-term reconstruction of infrastructure, such as schools, hundreds of shattered bridges and torn roads, followed by a long-term plan to protect against future flooding.\nGovernment flood relief office chief, Andrzej Pilat, said on Monday the government had gathered about $1 billion for the programme and got parliament's approval to borrow up to another $730 million from the central bank for the purpose.\nEven where waters had gone, the aftermath was terrible. Those with wrecked homes and farms were often close to despair.\n\"If it wasn't for the children, I would have thrown myself into this water,\" book-keeper Katarzyna Lameta told a reporter in the town of Klodzko, which looked like it had suffered a bombardment and where ruined buildings were layered in filth.\n\"How are we going to live here now?\" she said.\nPrime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz apologised in a statement for a remark he made before the full horror of the disaster became apparent, that ruined farmers should have been insured and could not expect help from government reserves.\nSince then the government has flung resources into rescue and relief, including fast 3,000 zloty handouts to affected households and grain or its cash equivalent for farmers.\n\"To everyone, and especially to flood victims, I simply say sorry for my inappropriate remark,\" Cimoszewicz said.\nOpposition parties hurled accusations that the government had been slow and inept in its response to the floods -- charges which the ex-communist Cimoszewicz rejects, stressing that the extent of the floods had taken everyone by surprise.\nIn politics, the key question was the impact of the disaster on September 21 parliamentary elections.\nBeforehand opinion polls suggested Cimoszewicz's Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), in office with a Peasant party during four years of economic progress, may be pulling ahead of its main challenger the rightist Solidarity Election Action (AWS).\nOpposition leaders said the polls should be delayed as flooded areas would be in no state to hold them, but the government was insisting they go ahead as planned.\nAs the worst of the floods appeared to be ending Poland's zloty currency, earlier knocked by the crisis and its economic implications, rose by about one percent on Tuesday.\n","classes":[90,94,97],"classes_pad":null}

This rounds out our Latin American investment,\" Chief Executive Martin Broughton told Reuters in an interview.\n\"Mexico is a profitable market and a long-term prospect market,\" he added.\nB.A.T expected the deal to add $140 million to its operating profits in 1998 and have a broadly neutral effect on earnings in the first full year.\nB.A.T's shares surged 15 pence to close at about 532.5 pence.\n\"The acquisition is a good fit given B.A.T's interest in North and Latin America,\" said one analyst. \"Providing it does not put too much strain on the balance sheet -- which I don't think it will -- it could be mildly earnings positive,\" he added.\nThe acquisition formed part of B.A.T's strategy to expand in less-developed regions such as Central Europe and Asia -- particularly in light of growing opposition to smoking in the United States.\n\"It's not exclusively in what people used to refer to as the Third World, but that's where the best growth opportunities are, so that comes pretty high up on the agenda,\" Broughton said, noting that B.A.T has always had a presence in less-developed countries.\nCLM has about 53 percent of the Mexican cigarette market, which ranked as the 15th-largest in the world, with about 47 billion cigarettes total, B.A.T said.\nThe Mexican company, with a 1996 pro forma trading profit of $80 million on revenues of $794 million, owns three of the top five brands in the Mexican market -- Raleigh, Boots and Montana.\nB.A.T, which has operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and other countries, had annual sales of more than 174 billion cigarettes in Latin America last year and reaped operating profit of 245 million pounds ($410 million) from the region in 1996.\nThe CLM acquisition marked B.A.T's re-entry into the Mexican tobacco market after government legislation in the 1970s forced it to cut its majority holding in Empresas La Moderna.\nB.A.T finally sold its remaining minority stake in Empresas La Moderna in 1989.\nUnder the CLM deal, B.A.T would receive 50 percent of the share capital of CLM and acquire the two statutory qualifying shares.\nSimultaneously, CLM would get an option to redeem the rest of its shares held by Empresas La Moderna. On the exercise of that option, B.A.T would wholly own CLM.\nB.A.T said the acquisition price consisted of $1.0 billion in cash, a loan note of $500 million, and the assumption of about $212 million of CLM debt.\nCLM currently has spare manufacturing capacity for some 15 billion cigarettes, which could help B.A.T boost its export business.\nIn addition, B.A.T said it saw considerable opportunities for tobacco leaf exports from Mexico, particularly because the country is outside the U.S. import quota.\nBroughton said he did not see any need for restructuring or layoffs at CLM.\n\"It's a very well-run, efficient business,\" he said, adding that B.A.T did not currently have any other acquisitions in the pipeline.\n","classes":[25,26,44],"classes_pad":null}

The ceasefire was intended to secure a seat at peace talks in September.\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said she had not given up hope of a positive vote on Wednesday, but added: \"It is becoming less clear, and more likely that there won't be an agreement tomorrow afternoon.\"\nThe main party representing the province's Protestant majority, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), made clear that it would oppose the government's arms decommissioning plans on Wednesday but would not walk out of the talks.\nKen Maginnis, the UUP's security affairs spokesman, said: \"My undestanding is that there has been no immediate breakthrough and on that basis it is certain that we will be voting down the government's paper.\n\"However it would be the Ulster Unionist Party's intention to maintain its link both with Downing Street and with the political process. It is not our way to abdicate our responsibility to the electorate.\"\nThe unionists oppose allowing spokesmen from Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, into the talks without any firm commitment from the guerrillas to hand in their guns and explosives.\nParticipants in the peace talks vote on Wednesday on an Anglo-Irish proposal that decommissioning of guerrilla arms should be tackled by a subcommittee in parallel with political negotiations.\nPolitical sources said that if the government lost the vote, talks could continue either on a bilateral basis between factions, or as \"proximity\" talks in separate rooms.\nDespite the expected rebuff on Wednesday, Mowlam said the government remained committed to a September 15 target for the start of substantive peace talks, as opposed to negotiations about how they should proceed.\nSinn Fein President Gerry Adams urged Protestant unionist parties to stay at the conference table and join Sinn Fein in trying to bridge the deep gulf between them.\n\"What are they afraid of? Can they not have the courage of their convictions and sit down with their neighbours, their fellow citizens, to try to work out a resolution of these difficulties?\"\nSinn Fein, which convinced the IRA it was worth calling a ceasefire, says the handing over of weapons should be part of a final settlement, not negotiations.\nPaisley told reporters after meeting Blair that admitting Sinn Fein to the talks was an \"act of betrayal\".\nPaisley's party is the second largest representing Protestants in Northern Ireland. A smaller party, the UK Unionists, withdrew from the talks on Monday.\nPaisley denounced Blair's government for its readiness to negotiate with \"IRA\/Sinn Fein terrorists\".\nPaisley's stance drew fire from the political wings of banned Protestant pro-British \"loyalist\" guerrilla groups, who accused him of running away from talks.\nThe last IRA ceasefire, declared in August 1994, was broken 17 months later when the guerrillas exploded a huge bomb in London's Docklands area, killing two people.\n","classes":[90,104,110],"classes_pad":null}
{"codes":["M14","M143","MCAT"],"headline":"FOCUS-Oil gains as Iraqi crude slips later into August.","text":"\nWorld oil prices edged gently upwards on Tuesday, underpinned by a growing realisation that Iraqi crude will not be exported for several weeks more.\nTraders had expected Iraq to resume its long-delayed oil sales at the start of August, pushing out hundreds of thousands of barrels of crude and bringing world prices crashing lower.\nThat time-frame appears to have slipped, although neither Iraq nor the United Nations, which supervises the sales under the oil-for-food deal, has formally said so.\n\"The middle of August is the earliest that people now actually expect barrels on their doorsteps,\" said Leslie Nicholas, oil analyst at brokers GNI.\nOn Tuesday Iraqi ambassador to the U.N. Nizar Hamdoon insisted there were no problems in implementing the aid distribution plan Baghdad says must be finalised before it will restart exports due to have commenced on June 9.\n\"I'm confident. Everybody needs money, so I don't foresee any problems,\" said Hamdoon.\nBut he added the review of the aid plan, formally submitted on Monday, will last at least through this weekend. Western diplomats had predicted it taking a week for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to agree the deal.\nThe sales, designed to relieve the sufferings of civilians under sanctions, should net Baghdad $2 billion every six months for food and medicine, but Iraq complains aid disbursement has been slow.\nOnce the hand-out plan is settled, price formulae for the oil must be submitted to the United Nations and contracts agreed with buyers, a process that could take at least another two weeks.\nIraqi worries and supply disruptions in the North Sea have provided a cushion for oil prices, stopping benchmark Brent blend from sinking below $18 a barrel. The price has fallen by 25 percent this year.\nSeptember futures contracts for world benchmark Brent blend crude closed up 13 cents at $18.22 a barrel.\nTraders are divided on how badly prices will be hit when Iraqi sales do resume, with some suggesting the bad news has already been factored in, and others saying the potentially huge volume will severely depress values.\nIraq has to sell $1 billion of oil in two 90 day periods, and has been told it can carry over only five percent's worth, forcing it to at least double previous export volumes in August to hit its cash target.\nIn the short-term oil prices have been helped by the recent strength of gasoline in the United States, where a key blending component in reformulated gasoline, methyl tertiary butyl ether, has shot up in price.\nDealers said there may also be some anticipation in the market of a bullish draw in crude and gasoline stocks in this week's U.S. industry stock data, due out tonight, after production disruption caused by Hurricane Danny.\n\t   Crude oil prices in dollars per barrel:\n\t\t\t\t\tJuly 22   July 21\n\t\t\t\t\t(close) (close)\n    Dated Brent\t\t   $18.47    $18.27\n    IPE September Brent\t $18.22    $18.09\n    NYMEX August light crude  $18.99    $19.20\n-- Sean Maguire, London newsroom, +44 171 542 8060\n","classes":[119,122,123],"classes_pad":null}

The trend, bolstered by the weak mark which helps German exporters, continued in later electronic trading and the IBIS DAX index closed up 3.81 percent at 4,297.64.\nTurnover was huge in contrast to other European markets, where investors were cautious before Greenspan began a two-day report to Congress on the U.S. economy at 1800 GMT. It hit 18.32 billion marks ($10.2 billion), the highest since Deutsche Telekom made its debut in November.\nMerger mania gripped banks as investors speculated that the overcrowded and fragmented sector faced a shakeout following Monday's news that Bayerische Vereinsbank AG and Bayerische Hypobank, would merge.\nShares in Commerzbank, which will slip to the fourth largest German bank if the merger goes ahead, jumped 6.9 marks or 12.3 percent to 63.0.\n\"It's the next target for a takeover,\" said a Frankfurt dealer. \"Or they are going to have to step up and make an acquisition.

Last week the share touched an all-time high of 1264 pence.\nShareholders have seen the value of their investment in SmithKline rise by 50 percent since the start of the year, and the company announced plans to split the stock and its American Depository Receipts on a one-for-two basis from August 26 to take account of the surge.\nThe group's strong portfolio of drugs saw sales rise 15 percent excluding currencies, helped by extraordinary growth in the United States where sales rose by 19 percent.\nThe star player were again ageing anti-biotic Augmentin, whose 17 percent sales gain to 215 million pounds helped it to keep just ahead of SmithKline's anti-depressant tablet Paxil\/Seroxat as SmithKline's top seller.\nPaxil, which the group licensed in, is proving to be a huge success in a market dominated by Eli Lilly & Co's Prozac, and sales soared 33 percent in the quarter to 211 million pounds. Sales in Britain jumped by 48 percent and in the U.S. they were ahead by 36 percent.\nConsumer Healthcare was another robust element, with sales up 14 percent excluding currency to 589 million pounds. The anti-smoking products Nicorette and Nicoderm were star performers, continuing to claim more than 90 percent of the lucrative U.S. market for gums and patches to help people quit smoking.\nSmithKline's Diversified Pharmaceuticals Services operation, which manages drug insurance benefits in the United States, and its U.S. clinical testing operation continued to be the group's weakest spots. However Leschley defended his decision to spend more than $2 billion on DPS in 1994, saying it gave SmithKline \"a competitive edge that others don't have.\"\nThe results and share price rise reinforced SmithKline's position as the highest-rated British drug stock, standing on a prospective price\/earnings ratio of 28.55 times estimated 1997 earnings compared with 27.22 for Zeneca Group Plc and 24.18 times for Glaxo Wellcome Plc.\n\"Really the results were bang in line with expectations and don't change the view that that it is the safest of the three big (British) companies,\" said Kleinwort Benson analyst Stephen Putnam.\n($ = 0.597 British Pounds)\n","classes":[15,16,44],"classes_pad":null}

The FTSE 250 index of mid-range stocks fell 2.3 points to 4,461.8 and the FT-A All-Share index, the broadest measure of the UK market, rose just 14.42 points or 0.6 percent to 2,270.91.  \nA rally in bank stocks after recent sharp losses helped propel the FTSE 100 higher, with Barclays up 39p at 12.78 stg, Lloyds TSB up 13p at 672p and Royal Bank of Scotland up 15p at 645-1\/2.\nYet, SmithKline Beecham was the biggest gainer in the FTSE 100, up 50p or 4.3 percent at 12.20-1\/2, after strong underlying growth in its second quarter results.\nGrand Met was the day's most active stock, up 15-1\/2p at 621-1\/2 in volume of 118 million shares as LVMH took the latest step in its campaign to muscle in on its planned merger with Guinness.  \nAiming to increase its leverage, the French group added to its stake in Grand Met while selling shares in Guinness, which fell 11p at 596-1\/2.\nBritish Airways was the biggest decliner in the FTSE 100 index, down 37p or 5.6 percent to 625-1\/2, after Deutsche Morgan Grenfell advised investors to switch out of the stock and into Lufthansa.\nKingfisher was another casualty, down 13p to 712-1\/2 amid worries over the impact of higher taxes on its French unit Darty.\n-- David Holmes, London Newsroom +44 171 542 4367\n","classes":[114,123],"classes_pad":null}
{"codes":["GCAT","GPOL","GVIO"],"headline":"No accord seen on disarming N.Ireland guerrillas.","text":"\nPeace efforts in Northern Ireland suffered a new blow on Tuesday when Britain acknowledged that pro-Protestant politicians will block proposals on how guerrilla groups should hand in their arms.\nThe faltering peace process also came under further threat when another pro-British political party announced it was quitting multi-party talks on the future of the province.\nIan Paisley, firebrand Protestant politician and pastor, said the talks in Belfast were \"dead in the water\" and his party planned to walk out.\nThe government has been consulting Protestant, pro-British unionist politicians from Northern Ireland who have been angered by the terms of a new ceasefire declared on Sunday by Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas.\nThe unionists oppose allowing the IRA's Sinn Fein political spokesmen into the talks without any firm commitment from the guerrillas to hand in the guns and explosives they have deployed in their 28-year war against British rule in Northern Ireland.\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said after talks at Prime Minister Tony Blair's Downing Street office in London that she had not given up hope.\nBut she added: \"It is becoming less clear, and more likely that there won't be an agreement tomorrow afternoon.\"\nPeace talks participants vote on Wednesday on an Anglo-Irish proposal that decommissioning of guerrilla arms be tackled by a subcommittee in parallel with political negotiations.\nSinn Fein President Gerry Adams urged Protestant unionist parties to stay at the conference table and join Sinn Fein in trying to bridge the deep gulf between them.\n\"The Unionist leaders are challenged by this situation in the same way that I and Sinn Fein are challenged by it.\n\"What are they afraid of? Can they not have the courage of their convictions and sit down with their neighbours, their fellow citizens to try to work out a resolution of these difficulties.\"\nAdams was speaking outside Sinn Fein party headquarters in west Belfast before talks with a delegation of Irish-Americans.\nSinn Fein, which convinced the IRA it was worth calling a ceasefire, says the handing over of weapons should be part of a final settlement, not negotiations.\nNorthern Ireland's leading unionist, David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), told Blair on Monday that the IRA must start handing its arms in or the talks would fail.\nBut Trimble, who was to have further contact with Blair on Tuesday, stopped short of pulling out from the talks.\nHis party has already made clear it will not vote for the decommissioning proposal as it stands.\nDespite the expected rebuff on Wednesday, the government remained committed to a September 15 target for the start of substantive peace talks, Mowlam said.\nPaisley said his Democratic Unionist Party would leave the peace talks after Wednesday's vote on guerrilla disarmament.\nPaisley told reporters after meeting Blair that admitting Sinn Fein to the talks was an \"act of betrayal\" that meant his party had to pull out.\nPaisley's party is the second largest representing the pro-British Protestant majority in Northern Ireland. A smaller party, the UK Unionists, withdrew from the talks on Monday.\nPaisley denounced Blair's government for its readiness to negotiate with \"IRA\/Sinn Fein terrorists\". The IRA declared its weekend truce to earn a seat for Sinn Fein when the main talks get underway in September.\nPaisley said: \"The fact is that IRA\/Sinn Fein has bombed its way to the negotiating table.\"\nThe present peace process should be scrapped, he said.\nPaisley's stance drew fire from the political wings of banned Protestant pro-British \"loyalist\" guerrilla groups, who accused him of running away from talks.\nThe last IRA ceasefire, declared in August 1994, was broken 17 months later when the guerrillas exploded a huge bomb in London's Docklands area, killing two people.\n","classes":[90,104,110],"classes_pad":null}

On the foreign exchanges, the dollar firmed as expectations grew that the single European currency would be soft.\nOutside German stocks, turnover was mostly thin on European markets as investors waited for the U.S. central bank chief to start his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to Congress at 1800 GMT after the close.\n\"The market is basically as dead as a dodo. Everyone is just waiting for Greenspan,\" said a senior dealer at a London stock brokerage.\nMarkets are fairly confident that Greenspan will not drop any bombshells when he addresses the House of Representatives banking sub-committee on Tuesday and the Senate banking committee on Wednesday.\nU.S. inflation seems to be well under control despite a strong economy, meaning interest rates should remain stable for the time being.\nBut Greenspan can always surprise, as he did last December when he warned investors on Wall Street against irrational exuberance. The comment sent stock markets around the globe tumbling, but not for long.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is now about 26 percent higher than its post-Greenspan low on December 16.\nGreenspan could make markets jittery if he said strong economic growth could put upward pressure on prices and interest rates later in the year. This would hurt stocks and bonds, but it would support the already strong dollar.\nBut some dealers said Greenspan might even give some positive surprises. \"He's got scope to update the Fed's forecasts for the economy, and if he does he will probably raise the growth estimate and cut the inflation figure,\" said the head of sales at an investment bank in London.\nNotwithstanding the Greenspan jitters, European stock markets took heart from Wall Street's recovery from heavy profit-taking in recent sessions, which began on Monday.\nAfter about an hour's trade on Tuesday the Dow was up a further 38.72 points at 7,945.51.\nGermany was the star performer and the DAX index of blue chips soared 122.02 points or 2.97 percent to close floor trade at a record 4,230.42.\nDealers said the dollar's rise to over 1.81 marks, a level not seen since 1991, also boosted exporters.\nBut banks were the market's main motor following Monday's news that two of Germany's largest commercial banks, Bayerische Vereinsbank AG and Bayerische Hypobank, would merge.\nThis triggered a scramble for banking stock, and particularly Commerzbank AG which jumped 6.9 marks or 12.3 percent to 63.0. Commerzbank will slip to fourth largest German bank if the merger goes ahead.\n\"It's the next target for a takeover,\" said one Frankfurt dealer about Commerzbank. \"Or they are going to have to step up and make an acquisition. They are the only one left without an international partner of some size. The pressure is growing.\"\nLondon got a less spectacular boost from Wall Street's firmer opening on Tuesday. By mid afternoon the FTSE-100 index, which tumbled 143 points in the past two sessions, was up 30.8 points or 0.64 percent at 4,836.5.\nWall Street also extended gains on the Paris bourse, which shrugged off Monday's announcement of company tax rises. Investors took a positive view, saying they would help France to qualify for European monetary union by cutting the state deficit closer to the qualifying target.\nThe CAC-40 was was up 37.26 points or 1.3 percent at 2,911.38 by the mid afternoon.\nThe foreign exchange markets were also waiting for Greenspan, but the dollar held near a 71-month high against the mark. \"What we saw really was mark weakness rather than anything particularly on the dollar,\" said Robert Hayward, an analyst at Bank America.\nDealers said worries that the single European currency would have a large number of founder members and would be weaker than the mark continued to weigh on the German unit.\nComments by Bundesbank council member Hans-Juergen Koebnick that the euro could be stable even if France and Germany had budget deficits in the region of 3.2-3.3 percent of GDP bolstered the dollar against the mark.\nThe target for joining the single European currency is 3.0 percent. Allowing some slippage could let a large number of countries into the currency, making the likelihood of a soft euro greater.\nThe dollar hit 1.8117 marks but volume was low as the market awaited Greenspan. It slipped against the yen to 115.70 after failing to hold above last week's high of about 116.50.\nCURRENCIES AT 1430 GMT\nThe dollar was at 1.8117 marks and 115.71 yen, compared with 1.7952 and 115.70 in late trading on Monday.\nSTOCK MARKETS AT 1430 GMT\nLONDON - The FTSE-100 index was up 30.8 points or 0.64 percent at 4,836.5.\nFRANKFURT - The DAX index closed up 122.02 points or 2.97 percent at 4,230.42.\nPARIS - The CAC-40 was up 37.26 points or 1.3 percent at 2,911.38.\nPRECIOUS METALS\nGold was fixed in the afternoon $328.25 after closing at $326.95 an ounce on Monday.

It is not our way to abdicate our responsibility to the electorate,\" he told Reuters.\nThe second largest Protestant party, the Democratic Unionist Party, said it would walk out after voting against the arms proposal.\nIts leader Ian Paisley, one of the unionist cause's most forceful spokesmen, said after talks with the prime minister that the Northern Ireland peace talks were \"dead in the water\".\nPaisley denounced Blair's government for its readiness to negotiate with \"IRA\/Sinn Fein terrorists\" and said admitting Sinn Fein to the talks was an \"act of betrayal\".\nThe smaller UK Unionist Party said on Monday it was quitting the talks.\nPeace talks participants will vote on an Anglo-Irish proposal that decommissioning of guerrilla arms be tackled by a subcommittee in parallel with political negotiations.\nPolitical sources said that if the government loses the vote, talks could continue either on a bilateral basis between factions, or as \"proximity\" talks in separate rooms.\nDespite expectation of a rebuff on Wednesday, the government remained committed to a September 15 target for the start of substantive peace talks, Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said.\nShe made clear, however, that she did not expect the Ulster Unionists to reverse their opposition to the disarmament proposal.\n\"It is becoming less clear, and more likely that there won't be an agreement tomorrow afternoon,\" she said on Tuesday.\nMowlam put a brave face on the expected Unionist \"no\" vote, saying the talks process was still in existence.\n\"We still have a process going, which is good news. I'm hopeful we can still keep the process going,\" she said.\nSinn Fein President Gerry Adams urged the unionists to stay at the conference table and join his party in trying to bridge the deep gulf between them.\n\"What are they afraid of? Can they not have the courage of their convictions and sit down with their neighbours, their fellow citizens, to try to work out a resolution of these difficulties.\"\nSinn Fein says the handing over of weapons should be part of a final settlement, not negotiations.\nAnother top Sinn Fein official, Martin McGuinness, predicted the unionists would probably join in the September peace talks despite their reservations.\n\"There is no doubt that within both communities in the North of Ireland, there is a very strong desire that we (must) have a negotiated settlement,\" McGuinness told reporters.\n","classes":[90,93,104,110],"classes_pad":null}

Green is accused of theft of confidential documents which ended up in the hands of the predators and a host of City institutions.\nEarlier this month three senior corporate financiers resigned after a probe by law firm Norton Rose found the conduct of those concerned fell \"well short of the standards of good business practice\".\nThe Bank of England and City watchdog the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) are both examining the Norton Rose report, this will lead to a decision over whether an investigation is needed and whether action will be taken.\nHambros had already made an unreserved apology to the Co-op in April over its conduct and paid a substantial sum to the group.\nHambro told the packed shareholders meeting at the group's headquarters he believed Hambros had acted quickly and decisively in commissioning the probe and acting on its conclusions.\nBut he emphasised the changes to internal procedures recommended by the report were because it had found failures in the implementation of the procedures rather than major deficiencies in the procedures themselves.\nHambro said he could not comment further on the \"CWS matter\" for legal reasons, although he acknowledged shareholders were \"interested and concerned\" about the bank's role.\nDespite intense speculation about Hambros' future following the embarrassing debacle, none of the shareholders at the meeting questioned the chairman or his successor Sir Chips Keswick on its ramifications.\nSome bankers say it will be hard for the bank to regain client confidence after the CWS affair, with relationships damaged by the fall-out.\nKeswick told reporters after the meeting Hambros was not looking for a new group chief executive.\n\"We are not looking for a new group chief executive. I will be a working chairman,\" he said.\nThere had also been speculation that Hong Kong-based investment fund Regent Pacific, which owns between three and four percent of Hambros, would question the board at the meeting.\nBut the fund, which has said it wants Hambros to return value to shareholders, did not do so.\nHambro's sense of humour was tested by one elderly shareholder who repeatedly interrupted the chairman with a succession of questions and opinions, several of which were posed in Latin.\nBut the exchanges were well received by shareholders and the meeting remained good-humoured.\nA former employee, Andrew Gibson-Watt, said the chairman had been \"unflinching in adversity\" during his 45 years at the bank, showing both courage and determination. Hambro would, he said, be able to spend more time on his farm in Gloucestershire.\nHambro, the fifth generation of the family since the bank's foundation in 1839, said there had been \"many ups and downs\" but he had enjoyed every moment and \"would not have missed it for the world\".\nHambros said it had appointed former Conservative government minister Peter Brooke as a non-executive director of the group. It has also appointed David Lewis, currently vice-chairman of Hambros Bank, to the board as a director. ($ = 0.597 British Pounds)\n","classes":[11,13,44],"classes_pad":null}

There are a lot of bonds unsold. The bond market and the currency have rallied a long way and for some they are too high.\"\nSterling has risen to its strongest levels in nearly seven years in trade-weighted terms due to the expectation of higher British interest rates and its safe haven status amid concern over the stability of EMU.\nBankers said European investors were unsure how much space was left on the upside. The pound this morning hit an 80-month high on the mark. At 1400 GMT it was touching 3.04 marks. In November 1995 the exchange rate was just below 2.17 marks, and sterling has gained 40 percent.\nOver 2.5 billion sterling has been issued in the Eurobond market in the last week. Ten-year sterling Eurobonds have been particularly prominent, with deals launched by Bank Nederlandse Gemeenten (BNG), DSL Bank and the World Bank.\nThe ten-year maturity is best to tap into both European and British demand, bankers said.\nBritish insurance companies and pension funds have bought some of the paper, issued by these top-rated borrowers, but would prefer higher-yielding corporate issuance.\n\"Domestically, pension funds, PEP funds and life insurance companies are looking for sterling debt,\" a Eurosterling analyst said.\n\"But they are not particularly big buyers of (triple-A) credits like the World Bank, DSL and BNG.

British company Tesco, which issued a 250 million sterling 10-year bond on Monday, paid 45 b.p. over.\nBut many British companies, like Imperial Chemical Industries Plc and British Telecommunications Plc, have tapped the dollar sector in recent months, because interest rates are lower and demand there is stronger, leading to a shortage of supply in sterling.\nIn September, once market participants return from summer breaks, there is expected to be more high-yielding corporate issuance, bankers said.\n\"We will see corporate issuance lower down the rating scale, and the sterling junk bond market will develop further,\" a dealer said. \"There are various deals in the pipeline, and we are expecting at least three or four.\"\nHigh-yielding corporate debt, or junk bonds, have been issued in European currencies for the first time this year, and the sector is expected to develop.\n\"Supply in sterling is a bit overdone right now,\" the Eurobond analyst said. \"Sterling swap spreads are attractive so borrowers are getting attractive funding levels relative to dollars, but they are also setting benchmarks in sterling,\" he said.\n\"After monetary union, there is expected to be a euro market, a dollar market, and a sterling market.\"\nBritish utilities, like Hyder Plc, are also expected to come to the market in the last quarter to raise funds to pay windfall taxes.\n-- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7748\n","classes":[115,123],"classes_pad":null}

The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close by the end of the year.\nCIBC-Wood Gundy Chief Executive Michael Rulle will become chief executive of the merged firm, to be named CIBC-Oppenheimer Corp. Oppenheimer Chairman and co-Chief Executive Stephen Robert and President and co-Chief Executive Nathan Gantcher will become vice chairmen.\nCIBC-Wood Gundy President John Hunkin told a news conference that the purchase would reduce CIBC's earnings by C20 cents (15 cents U.S.) a share in either 1997 or 1998 but add about 5 percent to CIBC's bottom line in the year after the deal was completed.\nIndustry insiders said the deal would wed CIBC-Wood Gundy's Wall Street loan financing operations to the high-end retail brokerage business of Oppenheimer.\n\"They don't have much underwriting activity.

Whether that's the right firm and that's the right price I don't know,\" Midland Walwyn Chief Executive Robert Schultz told Reuters.\nAnalysts said Oppenheimer's dowry was a raft of high-net-worth clients and a strong equity presence for CIBC-Wood Gundy's Wall Street operations.\nOppenheimer primarily is a brokerage firm serving high-net-worth individuals, Soifer said. The brokerage has somewhere between 500 to 1,000 brokers looking after such clients, he said.\nAn Oppenheimer spokesman said the firm's brokerage arm posted revenues of $780 million in the fiscal year ended April 30.

I think the market reaction was probably about correct,\" said Mark Chandler, senior economist with Goldman Sachs Canada.\nCanadian fixed-income and equity markets rallied in tandem with U.S. markets after Greenspan spoke before the House Banking subcommittee as part of his semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony.\nGreenspan said the Fed may eventually need to change rates but that economic growth was slowing for now. Greenspan also said the Fed must be ready to act if needed to head off inflation.\nCanada's 30-year benchmark bond was up C$1.49 to C$120.15 to yield 6.466 percent after the comments. The benchmark Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite index was up 70.61 points to 6718.00.\nThe Canadian dollar also strengthened from its open at C$1.3804 (US$0.7244) to trade at C$1.3774 (US$0.7260). The currency had opened weaker amid concern Greenspan would hint at a rate hike. A U.S. rate hike independent of a Canadian hike would likely attract capital flows away from Canada.\nThe Canadian money market was the only major Canadian market not to benefit from Greenspan's comments.

During the blockade, some fishermen angered ferry passengers by burning an American flag. The ferry was on its way to Alaska on Tuesday.\nAlaska Senator Frank Murkowski hinted at retaliation for the incident on Monday.

PCS announced the deal last August with hopes of gaining\ncontrol over 18 percent of the world's potash production and opening new distribution lines in Europe.\nKali & Salz is Germany's biggest producer of potash, one of three nutrients used to make agricultural fertilisers. The remaining 49 percent of the company is owned by east German development agency BvS.\nPCS, the world's largest potash company, is also a leader in the production of nitrogen and phosphate after billions of dollars worth of acquisitions over the past three years.\nThe Canadian company and BASF said late last year they struck a definitive sale agreement.\nBut Germany's Cartel Office in February said it would not allow the deal, citing a possible dominance of the German potash market.\nPotash and BASF then appealed to Rexrodt, who decided after a series of public hearings that the deal could reduce competition in the country's fertiliser industry.\n\"An obvious and concrete danger of anti-competition does not serve the public interest. Because of this, I did not give my permission for the sale,\" he said.\nHeggie said the decision was made despite backing for the deal from PCS, Kali & Salz, BASF, unions representing the target's workers and politicians in mining areas.\nPCS's offer was the best option for retaining 7,500 jobs at Kali & Salz, and the government move placed them at jeopardy, Gerhard Wolf, the BASF board member responsible for the fertiliser firm, said in Ludwigshafen, Germany.\nSam Kanes, an analyst with Scotia Capital Markets in Toronto, said investors should have factored the risk of the deal not being completed into their outlooks for PCS, given the previous disapprovals.\nKanes said he believed the company would probably not take the issue further.\n\"They've gone through a monopoly and a cartel 'no' ruling and now, of course, the economics minister, which carries the most amount of weight, said 'no' as well,\" he said.\n\"The German government has spoken. Going through the courts is just going to antagonize people.\"\nPCS planned to keep evaluating new acquisitions regardless of the outcome of the Kali & Salz deal's outcome, Heggie said.\n","classes":[13,25,26,40,44],"classes_pad":null}

U.N. officials say at least 150,000 are unaccounted for.\nThe U.N. initially set out to investigate allegations covering the seven-month revolt but Annan agreed to extend the time frame to 1993, when Mobutu was still in power.\nThe U.N. switched the leader of the investigation after Kabila objected to Chilean human rights lawyer Roberto Garreton, who has released two reports alleging massacres.\nGhenda dismissed as \"groundless\" suggestions that evidence was being destroyed.\n\"Traces of massacres of this extent cannot be wiped off. We have ourselves asked a U.N. team to come for a probe. We want clarification,\" he said.\nTen African countries, including eight heads of state, attended a summit in Kinshasa on Sunday at which they expressed support for Kabila in his efforts to rebuild the former Zaire.\nThey \"noted with dismay\" what they called a campaign of vilification against Kabila and the people of his Democratic Republic of the Congo, formerly Zaire, and against certain of its neighbours.\n\"They welcome the setting up of the U.N. commission to investigate alleged violations of human rights in the Congo. The leaders reiterate the demand for a neutral and independent commission,\" the statement said.\nGarreton's latest report, published on July 11, said future investigators should ask \"whether a genocide was planned and executed\" and whether the perpetrators should be brought before an international tribunal.\n\"According to the information received, several thousand people were killed, including large numbers of women and children,\" he said, adding that tens of thousands disappeared into forests where many probably died of hunger and disease.\n","classes":[90,93,110],"classes_pad":null}

His rallies, free T-shirts and other giveaways drew enthusiastic crowds, many of them teenagers.\nHis followers say that as leader of the largest militia before disarmament finished in February he would be the best guarantee of peace in Liberia.\nCritics said if he lost he would make Liberia ungovernable.\nBorn on January 29, 1948, Taylor had a native Liberian mother and a father of the mixed Americo-Liberian stock.\nHe marched into his West African homeland from Ivory Coast on Christmas Eve 1989 with a band of 150 associates reputed to be Libyan-trained. Taylor denies any Libyan links.\nHis plan was to oust Master Sergeant Samuel Doe, who broke the hold on power of the descendants of the freed slaves.\nHis National Patriotic Front of Liberia forces, a mix of descendants of slaves and indigenous tribes such as Mano and Gio, twice fought to the edge of the capital Monrovia.\nTwice, a Nigerian-led West African peacekeeping force, ECOMOG, thwarted them -- fuelling animosity between Taylor and regional giant Nigeria that helped perpetuate the conflict.\nAfter well over 150,000 deaths and a bloody 1996 flare-up in Monrovia, Liberia's neighbours finally rallied its squabbling warlords around a peace deal that held.\nECOMOG, long denounced by Taylor as an occupation army, ensured peace and disarmament, making the elections possible.\nDuring most of the war, Taylor was based in his northern stronghold of Gbarnga. He finally entered Monrovia in 1995, after signing a power-sharing agreement with his rivals.\n\"What I want is peace for our people, I want democracy for our people,\" he told a radio interviewer after a tumultuous welcome by supporters. \"I love these people,\" he added.\nTaylor and Nigeria had buried the hatchet, with Taylor travelling to its capital Abuja to sign the peace deal. The deal collapsed but much of the animosity that poisoned relations between the two was laid to rest.\nTaylor was widely blamed for the breakdown of a dozen or so deals to end the war, which smashed the economy and forced over half the pre-war population of 2.5 million from their homes.\nMany Liberians hold him responsible for triggering a showdown with indigenous Krahn in Monrovia in April and May 1996. Widespread looting devastated the capital, until then largely spared by the fighting.\nIn the runup to elections, Taylor made a barely disguised threat to the election commissioner who was under pressure from Taylor's rivals to delay the poll.\n\"If Henry Andrews attempts to postpone these elections, only the angels, not even ECOMOG will protect him,\" Taylor told state radio on July 8. \"If he does I am going to provide him with money for his plane ticket to leave the country.\"\nAn economics graduate educated at Bentley College outside Boston, Taylor was active in a U.S.-based student movement critical of William Tolbert, who was toppled and killed by Doe in 1980.\nTaylor fled Liberia in 1983, accused of embezzlement by Doe's government. Doe sought his extradition from the United States. Taylor escaped from a U.S. jail using a hacksaw and bedsheets.\nTaylor is married with eight children.\n","classes":[90,104,111],"classes_pad":null}

The commission estimates that 600,000 of about 700,000 registered voters cast their ballots.\nJohnson-Sirleaf, Taylor's closest rival, polled 45,195 votes or 9.5 percent. No other candidate managed up to five percent.\nTaylor needed 50 percent plus to win on the first round.\n\"Statistically it's just impossible,\" Johnson-Sirleaf said.\n\"These results show strikingly that there's only one candidate who obtained an overwhelming percentage of the votes. It is too good to be true,\" she said.\nShe said the dismal performance of other contenders even in their strongholds \"suggests other candidates have no friends, or relatives or party supporters\".\nTwo other warlords in Liberia's seven-year civil war -- Alhaji Kromah and George Boley -- also ran for president but neither has managed to poll up to five percent so far.\nIn an interview with BBC radio on Tuesday, Kromah also complained of poll irregularities despite a unanimous endorsement of the conduct of the elections by more than 500 international observers.\nOn Monday, Johnson-Sirleaf toned down earlier charges of poll irregularities, asking her supporters to play the role of a strong and constructive opposition.\nShe repeated that appeal on Tuesday, saying: \"Our ultimate objective is to ensure that there are no problems in the country,\" she said.\n","classes":[90,104,111],"classes_pad":null}

It was called after sharp differences over how to respond to a package of minimum constitutional reforms from the ruling KANU party.\n\"The institutional framework that the pro-reform movement will use for dialogue with the government and the ruling party on the constitutional, legal and administrative reforms is the National Convention Assembly (NCA),\" said Kivutha Kibwana.\n\"Dialogue will be undertaken through NCA's National Convention Executive Council and any of its appropriate committees,\" added Kibwana, a leading NCA\/NCEC official.\n\"This meeting resolves that the NCA...documents on reforms be presented to the government and president through the president's office on 23 July by representatives of the NCA and leaders of political parties,\" Kibwana added.\nThe NCA\/NCEC is a coalition of political parties, human rights bodies, civic groups and churches that had united Kenya's squabbling political parties in a rare show of unity in demanding reforms before presidential and parliamentary polls.\nBut that unity was sorely tested by Moi's agreeing to meet opposition parties this week and by the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) party agreeing to some reforms last week.\nNo date has been set for this year's general election but some opposition parties fear Moi wants to call it shortly after bills are approved by parliament, where KANU has a majority.\nThe meeting was also attended by parliamentary opposition leader Michael Kijana Wamalwa, who met Moi on security and reforms last week, and who was due to hold further meetings with the president on the subject this week.\nAll key leaders of opposition political parties were among the 105 people, including 57 parliament members, who attended.\n\"It was the single most unifying meeting of the NCA,\" said the Reverend Timothy Njoya, a Presbyterian minister whose arm was broken by police when they moved to stop a pro-reform rally in Nairobi and Kenyan provinces on July 7.\nAt least nine people were killed across Kenya after police moved in to stop rallies called by the NCA to press for constitutional reforms. Many of the parliament members were severely beaten.\n\"The people here represent true governance, represent a democratic government,\" Njoya told a news conference.\nKibwana said the meeting had resolved to continue \"mass action\" until the government agreed to \"bona fide dialogue\".\nThat meant an inter-denominational prayer service and a rally in the coastal resort of Mombasa would go ahead at the weekend and further action would be announced later.\nMombasa, Kenya's second city, is the coast centre of its tourism industry, the country's main foreign exchange earner.\nFollowing the worst political unrest in Kenya in seven years, KANU which is led by Moi, offered its package of reforms and a constitutional review, which would end after the polls.\nAttorney-General Amos Wako said on Friday he had began work on draft legislation which would be ready in two weeks.\nOne bill would give the president powers to appoint a commission to review the entire constitution, he said.\nThe second would repeal or amend 11 laws the opposition says are oppressive. The bills would be presented to the cabinet for approval before being tabled in parliament, Wako said.\nBut Kibwana said on Tuesday: \"Until bonafide dialogue is undertaken by government, it should stop unilateral steps like drafting bills on legal and administrative reforms since these can only be developed after dialogue is concluded.\"\n","classes":[90,104],"classes_pad":null}

Stronger than was in evidence in 1982\/83,\" he said.\nComparisons with previous El Nino years for assessing the potential effect on crops were therefore not useful, he said.\n\"A strong El Nino in 1997 will not necessarily have the same impact as in the 1980s,\" he added.\nThe rate of growth of planted areas in Africa was largely unknown, which meant the precise effects of El Ninos were unclear. Many Ivorian smallholders, for example, cultivated farms of three hectares or less and data on total farm area either did not exist or were out of date.\nIllicit production by migrant farmers in protected forests in Ivory Coast further complicated data collection.\nBritish consultant Landell Mills said in a recent report that world production in 1982\/83 had been cut by 200-300,000 tonnes by the effects of El Nino.\nA local crop analyst said the current El Nino showed signs of being strong but, like other analysts, he expected little immediate impact in 1997\/98.

It will start probably next summer but it is difficult to say,\" Orebi managing director Sylvain Orebi told Reuters by telephone from France.\nOrexis selected a site for a factory in Ivory Coast's second port of San Pedro in early 1997, targeting a bean grinding capacity for cocoa cake and butter of 25,000 tonnes, rising to 75,000 in the long term, he said.\nFactory components would be imported and assembled with a view to producing European food grade cocoa by-products exporting mainly to United States and European ports, including Spain.\n\"We want to meet European quality by European standards,\" Orebi added.\nFactory plans have not been released but architects have visited the site, exporters in San Pedro said.\nAnother French firm, chocolate manufacturer CEMOI, recently began constructing a 50,000 tonnes-capacity processing plant in the commercial capital Abidjan after negotiating an incentive package with Ivorian officials.\n\"You need some cooperation to overcome some of the problems of working in Ivory Coast,\" Orebi said, pointing to higher variable cost elements such as energy prices.\nIvory Coast's cocoa grinding capacity from four existing factories stands at around 160,000 tonnes but local crop analysts expect the 1996\/97 grind to be around 145,000 tonnes.\nIvory Coast wants the figure to reach 50 percent of annual cocoa production by 2000 as a way of adding export value. A record 1995\/96 crop of 1.2 million tonnes was followed by another large crop in 1996\/97 -- which totalled around 1.06 million tonnes in July.\nOrexis' site is within a few hundred metres of Swiss-French processor Barry Callebaut's SACO factory in San Pedro and will be the growing export town's second factory if built.\n\"All (the factory's) exports will go through San Pedro,\" Orebi said, adding that San Pedro would definitely need to expand port capacity to handle rising cocoa percentages of Ivorian cocoa grown in its hinterland.\nSan Pedro handles about one third of Ivorian crops. Ivory Coast's other processor, Abidjan-based UNICAO, plans to expand its capacity by over 20,000 to 86,000 tonnes by 1998.\nOrebi said a factory in Ivory Coast would help Orexis lock in good quality beans from Ivorian crops, which he said looked set to remain large.\n\"The crop will be very good for next year.

But some stayed outside marvelling at the spectacle.\nThe independence war fighters, some crippled and on crutches, sang and held placards, calling on Mugabe to address them. \"Mugabe our patron please meet us,\" read one of the placards.\n\"We will not leave until he comes,\" they shouted, but made no attempt to stop delegates using a side entrance to the conference centre.\nVarious workshops started on time. The formal opening ceremony of the four-day summit will take place on Wednesday.\nArmed police kept a low profile and directed traffic to the side entrance.\nThere were dozens other riot-control police posted around the conference venue, on the edge of central Harare, and some of Mugabe's top security aides were mingling with the demonstrators.\nThe aides refused to comment on whether the president would address the ex-combatants, whose protest is sure to embarass the government in the presence of visiting dignitaries.\nHours before the protest, the U.S. delegation to the summit led by civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater arrived in Harare to take part in the Fourth African\/African-American Summit.\nMugabe, Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and Organisation of African Unity (OAU) Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim are among the over 30 African leaders expected at the meeting.\nHundreds of angry veterans marched on Mugabe's official residence on Monday to protest against government handling of a war victims' compensation fund which was suspended in March over allegations of fraud and mismanagement.\nMonday's protest took place as Mugabe announced a judicial commission to investigate charges.\nMugabe, Zimbabwe's ruler for the last 17 years, is patron of the Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association, the representative body of thousands of guerrillas whom he led in a seven-year bush war that culminated in Zimbabwe's independence in 1980.\nBesides Jackson and Slater, the American delegation includes the chief exeutives of Fortune 500 companies such as Owens-Corning, Chrysler Corporation, Colgate-Palmolive, Kellogg Company, Chevron Corporation, and Procter and Gamble Company.\nThe convener of the business conference, American civil rights leader Leon Sullivan, told a news conference late on Monday he was confident a number of deals would be reached at the meeting.\n\"It's not going to be a talk show.

Production could be five percent down by the end of this year if the funding problem is not resolved,\" said one company official.

They point to the fact that production has been stable or rising in recent years despite similar budget cuts.\nBut the companies warn that squeezing the industry can only go so far and say that even if they are given higher budgets in 1998, it may take them the rest of the year to get back to 1996 levels before talking of an increase.\n\"We will cut investment right now and production will look good,\" said Caldwell. \"Next year and the following year you will really see declining impact in the nation's production.\"\nNigeria is utterly reliant on revenues from crude oil exports of around two million barrels per day (bpd), the vast majority pumped by the joint ventures, in which state-run Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has an average 57 percent stake.\nThe ruling generals, who have tried to tighten government purse strings since coming to power in 1993, have not explained the reasoning behind cutting investment in Nigeria's most important revenue earner, other than to say cash is short.\nSo far they have also shunned privatisation of the industry, regarded as strategic and in which vested interests are strong, to give it a freer hand with its own money.\nIndustry analysts say that a government target of 2.5 million bpd by the year 2000 looks increasingly unrealistic.\nIn the long term, oil producers put more hope in production sharing contracts for deep offshore blocks, which will allow as much investment as needed while Nigeria takes its cut.\nThe meeting is due to take place in the capital Abuja with oil minister Dan Etete and officials from the planning and finance ministries.

No other candidate managed to make four percent.\nThe tense anxiety in the runup to polling on Saturday has subsided. Many Liberians and watchers of the West African state have turned their focus to how Taylor can salvage the country he plunged into a devastating civil war seven years ago.\n\"The big question now is Taylor's ability to reconcile the many factions in the country, including his own political enemies,\" said a European expert on Liberia in Monrovia.\nIt is a question that has troubled many foreign donors who helped fund the elections intended to wrap up a civil war accord brokered by Liberia's West African neighbours.\nFormer U.S. president Jimmy Carter was among more than 500 foreign observers of the elections. Many weighty members among them sought assurances from the candidates that whoever won the presidency would put a premium on reconciliation.\n\"Overall the election represents a very important step forward for Liberia, and its long-term prospects for lasting peace and democracy,\" said a statement by the ex-president's Carter Centre team of monitors.\nEven before the latest results were issued, Johnson-Sirleaf appeared to acknowledge Taylor's increasingly daunting lead.\nToning down her earlier blistering attack on the conduct of the elections, she rallied her supporters to prepare for the role of \"a strong and constructive opposition\".\n\"Should it come to to us becoming an opposition party in this country we must remain a strong and constructive opposition, that is working towards helping our people return to normal lives,\" she said to cheers from supporters packing the tearrace of her Unity Party headquarters.\nTaylor needs 50 percent plus to avoid an August 2 run-off, but even his opponents say a second round now looks unlikely.\n\"The performance of the other candidates is too dismal. You can't have a runoff when so many of them are scoring below one percent at this stage,\" said a political party representative observing results compilation at elections headquarters.\nTaylor is seen by many as the forceful leader needed in the post-war period.

{"codes":["GCAT","GPOL","GREL"],"headline":"Yeltsin throws out controversial religion bill.","text":"\nPresident Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday rejected a controversial bill, opposed by the United States and Pope John Paul II, that would have imposed tough new curbs on religious freedom in Russia.\nIn a statement released by the Kremlin, Yeltsin said he had reluctantly decided not to sign the draft law \"On Freedom of Conscience and Religious Association\" because it contradicted Russia's constitution guaranteeing equality for all confessions.\n\"This was a difficult decision,\" he said, noting that the powerful Russian Orthodox Church and a majority of deputies in parliament's lower house, the State Duma, had supported the bill.\n\"But many articles in the bill infringe the constitutional rights and freedoms of the citizen, establish inequality of different confessions and contradict international obligations undertaken by Russia,\" Yeltsin said.\nThe bill, overwhelmingly approved by both the Duma and the upper house, the Federation Council, favoured traditional faiths in Russia. Apart from Orthodoxy, which Russians closely associate with their culture and national identity, these include Islam, Buddhism and Judaism.\nIt said only confessions that were registered at least 15 years ago -- when religion was still tightly controlled by the atheistic Communist Party -- could qualify as \"religious organisations\".\nOthers would have had to wait 15 years before applying for full legal rights.\nThe bill would also have imposed new restrictions on foreign missionaries operating in Russia.\n\"Signing the bill in its present form...would have led to religious conflicts inside the country,\" said Yeltsin, who rejected the bill while on holiday in central Russia.\nSupporters of the law, which included the powerful Russian Orthodox Church, said it would help control the big post-communist explosion in religious sects that have fed on Russians' poverty, spiritual hunger or simple curiosity.\nJapan's notorious Aum Shinri Kyo, for example, whose members stand accused of killing 12 people by releasing deadly nerve gas on the Tokyo subway in 1995, had many followers in Russia.\nCritics of the bill argued that it marked a step back to Soviet-style control of religion and that it violated the constitution by giving a few major confessions big advantages over minority religions.\nThe Pope said the law threatened the Roman Catholic Church's survival in Russia, and the U.S. Senate had threatened to withhold aid worth about $200 million if it had been approved.\nLast week the Russian foreign ministry said the U.S. Senate pressure could be counter-productive, raising fears among human rights groups that Yeltsin might sign the bill in a fit of nationalist pique and not on its possible merits.\nHuman rights groups had said they would appeal to the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly and to Russia's Constitutional Court if Yeltsin approved the law.\nThe bill now goes back to parliament, in summer recess until September, for reconsideration. Yeltsin's veto could be overturned by a two-thirds majority in both chambers.\nYeltsin has recently vetoed a range of bills passed by the Communist-dominated Duma, including one that would block the return of art treasures seized in Germany by the Soviet army after World War Two.\n","classes":[90,104,106],"classes_pad":null}

There was no immediate comment from the bank.\nThe central bank spokesman did not mention the charges made by its chairman, Sergei Dubinin, who accused Unikombank last week of misappropriating half a billion dollars in government money, including $275 million to Moscow region and $237 million to MAPO-MiG, manufacturer of MiG fighter aircraft.\nDuring a supervisory check, the central bank found Unikombank was one in a chain of banks through which the Finance Ministry forwarded state funds in the form of government MinFin bonds to Moscow region and MAPO-MiG, he said.\nWhen Unikombank received the bonds, it sold them and kept the proceeds, Dubinin charged. The bank then dismissed his charges as \"absurd\".\nA Moscow region spokeswoman said on Tuesday it had no outstanding claims on Unikombank.\nBut the commercial director of MAPO-MiG, deputy chief executive officer Vladimir Truderung, said the company had not received government funds of around $230 million.\n\"So far we have not received the money,\" Truderung said.\nIt was not clear what next step the central bank would take and whether the issue would grow, as some of the Russian media have said, into a huge financial and political scandal.

He said it was too early to estimate costs of the whole reconstruction.\nThe government now has 650 million zlotys ($187 million) reallocated from the current budget to spend on flood relief and plans to borrow $600 million from the World Bank and the European Investment Bank (EIB) to help finance the programme.\nParliament has also let the government borrow 2.5 billion zlotys from the central bank this year, of which one billion was taken late last week, Finance Minister Marek Belka said.\nHe added he did not plan to change the outline of the 1998 budget draft, which assumes a deficit amounting to 1.9 percent of gross domestic product.\nThe draft forecasts that inflation will fall to 9.5 percent in December next year from 13 percent planned this year and that GDP will continue to grow at this year's planned rate of 5.5 percent -- targets which some analysts now doubt because of the flood.\nUnder the programme, the government will offer cheap loans, more credit guarantees, breaks on income and value added tax for companies damaged by the flood, as well as delays in some obligatory payments to the treasury, Cimoszewicz said.\n\"But it will not be the case that tax reliefs will be offered for the whole regions...

About 1,000 houses and flats will be built for those who cannot afford such loans.\nFarmers will get one tonne of wheat per hectare of land flooded, or its money equivalent.

We have not had such a difficult harvest in the past 20 years,\" Yugoslav Chamber of Commerce Vice President Milutin Cirovic told a meeting of the chamber's board of directors.\nFrequent and heavy rains in July have slowed harvesting and reduced both average yield and grain quality.\nIn the granary region of Vojvodina, storms and hail had damaged or completely destroyed wheat on some 30,000 hectares out of Yugoslavia's total wheat area of 817,600 ha.\nSerbian Agriculture Minister Jovan Babovic said on Monday wheat had been reaped from around 480,000 ha, or 58 percent of Serbia's wheat area, by July 21. Babovic stuck to earlier wheat crop forecasts of 3.0 million tonnes.\nMontenegro, Serbia's partner in Yugoslavia, accounts for just 2,200 ha of the wheat area.\n\"With 125 milimetres of rainfall registered over the past 20 days, we are in a situation today where yield continues declining,\" Cirovic said.\nYield varied greatly from less than 3.0 tonnes per hectare to 7.0, with the average for the crop harvested so far 3.76 tonnes per ha, the chamber said in its latest report.\nThe chamber estimated that this year's crop of 2.8-3.0 million tonnes would meet the country's needs until the next harvest, leaving some 300,000 to 500,000 tonnes for export.\n\"But yield could decline further since grain quality is deteriorating as the harvest progresses. If rains continue at such intensity we may be brought into a situation to reap wheat for fodder rather than bread,\" Cirovic said.\nAn official of the federal Agriculture Ministry on Friday forecast a surplus of up to 600,000 tonnes from a 1997 wheat crop estimated at around three million tonnes.\nAround 40 percent of the wheat in warehouses so far has had to be dried, which raises the price by 0.08 to 0.10 dinars per kg, Cirovic said.\nThe Yugoslav government set the guaranteed price for the 1997 crop at 1.00 dinars for first, 0.90 dinars for second and 0.80 dinars for third quality wheat.\nSome 550,000 tonnes of wheat were purchased in advance before the harvest began -- 356,000 tonnes by the Serbian Commodity Reserve Agency, 40,000 tonnes by wheat milling organisations, 130,000 tonnes by banks and firms and 20,000 tonnes by traders and entrepreneurs.\nThe remaining market surplus not yet contracted for delivery is seen at around 1.6 million tonnes, including 100,000 tonnes of seed wheat.\nTrade in wheat is regulated by the government and limited to commodity reserves, milling organisations, seed wheat firms and companies authorised by the commodity reserve agency.\n--Amra Kevic, Belgrade newsroom +381 11 311 4305\n","classes":[29,32,44,90,112,119,120,123],"classes_pad":null}

The legislation was adopted in June by the multi-ethnic central government.\nThe United States and European countries, anxious to keep aid flowing to Bosnia, decided to drop demands for the country to clinch a deal with the International Monetary Fund as a condition for the conference.\nThe $100 million IMF agreement has been held up in part because of a politically sensitive dispute over the design of an interim joint currency. Serb leaders have insisted on placing nationalist symbols on the interim currency which offend their Moslem and Croat rivals.\nThis week's conference will mark the first time representatives from the country's Serb republic will have an opportunity to make their case before donors.\nThe nationalist Serb leaders, who fought against Bosnian independence, failed to turn up at last year's fund-raising conference because they refused to participate as part of a joint Bosnian delegation.\nAs a result, the Serbs have only received about two percent of the more than one billion in aid donated to Bosnia. Wages and economic growth in the Serb entity are lagging far behind the Moslem-Croat federation.\nLast year's conference raised $1.8 billion in pledges and donors have delivered some $1.4 billion so far. The reconstruction aid has fuelled a 30-35 percent growth rate in Bosnia this year.\nSome donor governments were considering withholding non-humanitarian aid to the Serb entity unless authorities handed over wartime leader Radovan Karadzic and other indicted war criminals to a U.N. tribunal.\nDiplomats in Sarajevo said the seven largest industrialised nations which contribute the bulk of the aid probably would probably not call for such strict conditions.\nInstead, most donors favoured an aid package of up to $500 million for Serb territory which would be linked to compliance with economic reforms.\nTying economic aid to cooperation with the U.N. war crimes tribunal had so far proved fruitless and Western governments would seek other means to secure the extradition of fugitives wanted by the tribunal, diplomats said.

He estimated the total cost of the Albanian deal with China at $10 million.\nThe army division responsible for the missiles reported directly to the ex-communist country's chiefs of staff.\nIf confirmed, the rocket looting would be the worst in a string of incidents to affect Albania's armed forces, which put up practically no resistance when people stormed depots and took away light and heavy weapons, bombs and explosives.\nA government of National Reconciliation formed in March to save the country chaos and anarchy tried to boost the army's morale by reorganising many units.\n","classes":[90,91,92],"classes_pad":null}

Ukraine alone is said to owe around $1 billion, with many debts dating back to 1993.\nBut having halted exports to cash-strapped states like Ukraine, Turkmenistan -- a desert Central Asian country with a population of around four million -- may also have doomed its export-oriented gas extraction business to deep recession.\nOutput of natural gas plummeted in June to 0.551 billion cubic metres (bcm) from 2.689 bcm in March.\nTurkmenistan, which boasts huge reserves of natural gas estimated at 21 trillion cubic metres and which ambitiously plans to boost production to 284 bcm by the year 2000 from 35 bcm last year, exports gas only via Russian pipelines.\nIn line with a deal signed last year between Russia's gas monopoly Gazprom and Turkmenistan, the Russian partner was to allow the Central Asian state to export 20 bcm of gas to Europe this year and around the same amount to ex-Soviet states.\nBut the ex-Soviet republics were unable to pay, while Turkmenistan officials said there have been no gas exports to Western Europe at all since January this year, when the contract with Gazprom came into force.\nTurkmen officials and Western energy analysts agree that Turkmenistan will need a new deal with Gazprom in order to break through to the paying markets in Western Europe.\n\"Very soon, probably in August, (Turkmen President Saparmurat) Niyazov will visit Moscow, where this issue will be a topic of his talks with Russia's (President) Boris Yeltsin,\" an official from the state-run Turkmenneftegaz oil and gas company told Reuters.\nSome energy analysts say the talks could be tricky.\n\"Turkmenistan basically needs to come to an agreement with Gazprom to get access to markets in Western Europe, and it may not be in Gazprom's interests to allow this access,\" said Stephen O'Sullivan from London-based MC Securities.\n\"One day Ukraine will be good but at the moment it faces a shortage of cash and can't really pay for the gas,\" he said.\nTurkmenistan and a Western consortium plan to build a giant gas pipeline to Pakistan across the north of Afghanistan, but the project is hampered by a civil war raging in Afghanistan.\nAgainst the backdrop of a gas sector in deep crisis, aggravating general economic chaos, Turkmenistan's Niyazov, who enjoys a Soviet-era personality cult and rules his nation with a firm hand, may now be facing the acute problem of finding funds to provide the country with enough bread until the new harvest.\nNiyazov's plans to achieve self-sufficiency in grain were ruined this year by a paltry harvest of 640,000 tonnes, barely half the initial target of 1.2 million tonnes.\nThe official Turkmen Press news agency has said that last year Turkmenistan spent $800 million on substantial grain imports, when it harvested a meagre 480,000 tonnes.\nIt said Niyazov already sacked three regional heads and a deputy prime minister over the poor crop this year, but has not given any estimates of Turkmenistan's possible grain imports.\n","classes":[33,35,44,45,70],"classes_pad":null}

Consortia led by Uneximbank and a combined Alfa-Most bank group are seen as likely bidders.\nRussia's domestic long distance service is abysmal, with some analysts saying only 20 percent of calls are successful, but Svyazinvest has not been able to raise many funds to channel into infrastructure growth.\nSome regional operators have been held back from issuing new shares and Svyazinvest does not have the money to buy stock to preserve its controlling stake.\nIsmailov said the company annually needed $3.5-$4.0 billion to connect 3.5 million phones per year by 2003, which would bring Russian telephone density to European levels.

Deliveries to Belarus were slashed from 45.4 mcm a day.\nGazprom, a monopoly, has often cut and then resumed deliveries to the two Slavic neighbours in the past over nonpayment. It has been taking a tougher approach to debtors since the Kremlin began a crackdown on the company to get it to pay more cash into the budget.\nBut the gas giant's hands are tied.\n\"Yes, this time they really mean it,\" said European gas expert Jonathan Stern of Gas Strategies Ltd in London. \"But no, it's not the end of the era of cheap supplies.\"\nGazprom, the world's largest natural gas producer and Russia's biggest tax payer, with payments accounting for eight percent of Gross Domestic Product, has two Achilles' heels.\nOne is Ukraine, a country with an economy not yet weaned off the old Soviet-style system under which it received vast quantities of subsidised gas.\nA Ukrainian energy official said the Ukrainian government owed Russia $3.5 billion for gas supplies since 1992, including $1.4 billion in restructured debts.\nMost of Gazprom's 123.5 billion cubic metres, or bcm, of gas exports to Europe last year travelled via Ukraine, accounting for 60 percent of Europe's total gas imports.\nGazprom had agreed to supply Ukraine this year with 53 bcm of Russian gas, or 44 percent of the European total. That would work out at 145 mcm a day. It was not clear how the reduction announced on Tuesday related to this figure.\nUkraine's consumption levels mean Gazprom cannot afford to let Kiev not pay on time for supplies. But the monopoly has little room for manoeuvre if it wants to keep deliveries running steadily to Europe via Ukraine.\n\"There must be the possibility we'll see some of these supplies tapped,\" Stern said, referring to Ukraine's habit of simply siphoning off Russian gas destined for Europe when deliveries for domestic use are cut.\nInterfax news agency quoted a Belarussian government source as saying reduced volumes to Belarus made it difficult to onpass Russian supplies to Poland and Lithuania but Smirnov said neither of the cuts would affect any exports.\nGazprom can afford to be harsher with Belarus, which owes $125.5 million for unpaid supplies -- but not for long.\nThe company plans a huge new pipeline network through Belarus and Poland into Germany to double supplies from Russia's Arctic Yamal peninsula to Europe by 2010.\nGazprom, which sits on the world's largest gas reserves, exports 14 percent of output to former Soviet republics and 20 percent to central, south-eastern and western Europe. The remaining two-thirds is consumed in Russia.\nIn the past Gazprom has been content to collect payment in goods but it now needs better cash flows to keep up with the brisk tax contributions demanded by Moscow's reformist cabinet.\nSome analysts have estimated that Gazprom gets paid in cash for only five percent of its deliveries and that only half of its customers ever pay at all in any form.\nIn the past, the Kremlin has forgiven some of Belarus's gas debts in exchange for maintaining Russian military sites. Both Minsk and Kiev have settled some past debts by taking supplies in exchange for billions of dollars in transit fees.\n\"This is a major economic reform problem, not just a gas problem,\" Stern said.\n","classes":[29,33,35,44],"classes_pad":null}

I don't think they can continue at this rate.\"\nRussia exported 80,000 tonnes of nickel, used mainly in the manufacture of stainless steel, to countries outside the Commonwealth of Independent States in the first five months of the year, a 26 percent jump on year-ago levels.\nThe increase is partly explained by low exports early in 1996, but still outstrips most analysts' forecasts.\n\"Russian supply has taken most people by surprise this year,\" said Angus MacMillan, analyst at Billiton Metals Ltd.\nRussia managed the sharp rise through higher output from dominant producer Norilsk Nickel as well as by drawing on stocks.\n\"The figures suggest there was a bigger stockpile in Russia than we were aware of,\" MacMillan said.\nNorilsk  plans to boost 1997 nickel output by 20 percent to 213,000 tonnes, making it the world's number one producer, ahead of Canada's Inco group.\nBut analysts and Norilsk officials have questioned the group's ability to push through such a big rise so quickly, and expect to see Norilsk produce between 190,000 and 200,000 tonnes this year -- still about a fifth of world supplies.\nEven this lower target could be missed if problems at Norilsk's Nikelyevy Zavod (Nickel Factory), a smelter at the flagship Norilsky Kombinat (Norilsk Combine) are not resolved quickly.\nThe group said two out of five furnaces at the plant were not working after a fire on July 18. The Nickel Factory is one of three nickel smelters owned by Norilsk, and produces between 60,000 and 80,000 tonnes of nickel a year, analysts said.\nNorilsk spokesman Anatoly Komrakov said on Tuesday output had not been significantly affected by the fire so far, but could not say how long it would take to repair the damage.\nAnalysts said lengthy complications could be bullish.\n\"Any prolonged disruption could have a fairly big impact. This plant is one of the biggest sources of feed for the Norilsk refinery,\" said Fidelis Madavo, analyst at CRU International.\nLennon said the Nickel Factory produced around 60,000 tonnes of nickel in 1996 out of Norilsk's total of 177,185 tonnes.\nBut analysts are not getting excited about the prospects for significant nickel price rallies any time soon.\nRussia dealt the market a double blow by increasing not only primary nickel supply, but also stainless steel exports -- an alternative source of feed for stainless steel mills.\n\"Yes, primary exports are higher, but scrap is the real problem. Steel mills are not making much money, so they are limiting raw material costs by taking more scrap,\" Madavo said.\nPlentiful exports should keep a lid on prices at least until the fourth quarter, when analysts expect a recovery in demand.\nMacMillan said total world nickel stocks represented around 13 weeks of supply, and it would take a more significant supply shock to set a sustained rally in motion.\n\"The market has not paid much attention to the Norilsk news. It will take a more substantial cut to send prices higher.\"\nBenchmark three month nickel futures on the LME were quoted at $6,825\/50 a tonne at 1410 GMT, up slightly from Monday's afternoon kerb close of $6,790.\n--Moscow Newsroom +7095 941 8520\n","classes":[29,33,35,44,119,121,123],"classes_pad":null}

Critics say the law violates the constitution by giving a few major confessions big advantages over minority religions.\nThe Pope says the law threatens the Roman Catholic Church's survival in Russia, and the U.S. Senate has treatened to withhold funds worth about $200 million if it is approved.\nHuman rights activists said on Tuesday the signals from the Kremlin suggested Yeltsin was likely to sign the law.\n\"I hope it does not happen, but it may turn out that the steps taken by the Senate have the opposite effect to the one intended,\" Diederik Lohman of Human Rights Watch\/Helsinki, a watchdog group, told Reuters.\n\"This may mean the decision is not taken according to the merits of the law but as an emotional reaction. That would be unfortunate.\"\nHe said Human Rights Watch\/Helsinki planned to appeal to the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly if Yeltsin approved the law. Another opponent of the law said on Monday he would appeal in Russia's Constitutional Court if it were approved.\nThe law favours traditional faiths in Russia. Apart from Orthodoxy, which Russians closely associate with their culture and national identity, these include Islam, Buddhism and Judaism.\nIt says only confessions that were registered at least 15 years ago -- when Russia was still controlled by the atheistic Communist Party -- can qualify as \"religious organisations\". Others must wait 15 years before applying for full legal rights.\nThe law was overwhelmingly approved in parliament and is backed by politicians from all sides of the political spectrum. It has the blessing of Russia's most senior clergyman, Orthodox Patriarch Alexiy.\nBut the U.S. Senate fears a trend back towards the totalitarianism of the Soviet era. The Pope has written to Yeltsin to express his concerns for Catholics' rights.\nYeltsin can sign the law or send it back to parliament for reconsideration. His veto could be overturned by a two-thirds majority in both chambers of parliament.\nThe constitution says he must decide within 14 days of receiving the law from parliament. Parliament, which approved it on July 4, has up to five days to deliver the law to him -- indicating that he must make a decision no later than Wednesday.\n\"There is no doubt the president faces an extremely difficult task because of the many different opinions of an internal and external political nature, and of an economic and social nature,\" government spokesman Igor Shabdurasulov said.\nThe Kremlin has kept largely silent on this issue, although Interfax quoted a Kremlin source last week as saying Yeltsin was likely to sign the law.\nSergei Shakhrai, Yeltsin's representative to the Constitutional Court, also indicated he expected him to sign it.\n\"The best way to convince the president to sign a law necessary for Russia is to put pressure on him, especially from abroad, and threatening sanctions,\" Interfax quoted him as saying.\n","classes":[90,104,106],"classes_pad":null}

But with Russian markets at or near record levels, foreign investors have priced in the improvement.\n\"The IMF is arriving in particularly positive circumstances,\" said Thomas Balastrery, director of research at Creditanstalt Investment Bank, an Austrian bank, in Moscow.\nOver the last 12 months the IMF has repeatedly delayed payments of its $10 billion three-year credit because revenues were running below budgeted levels, undermining fiscal policy.\nBut in June tax revenues were running at an end-year monthly target of 30 to 34 trillion roubles  ($5.2  to $5.9 billion) -- 100 percent of budgeted levels -- double January's 14.5 trillion, Balastrery said.\nJune's figure was swollen by unrelenting pressure on one of Russia's biggest companies, gas monopoly Gazprom, to pay up.\nBut President Boris Yeltsin's youthful new cabinet, dominated by First Deputy Prime Ministers Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov, is forcing a whole raft of Russia's biggest companies to restructure their debts to the government.\n\"There's no reason for the IMF not to release the money... inflation and money supply are on target,\" said Per Maelstrom, director of research at Brunswick brokerage.\n\"They're maybe not 100 percent right on the budget deficit but they're doing their utmost to put the situation in order.\"\nThe IMF mission is conducting a quarterly review of the Russian economy to decide whether to pay out a $700 million tranche of its loan.\nThe failure of large companies to pay their taxes is part of a much wider web of non-payments strangling the Russian economy.\nWith the help of Gazprom's back taxes, the government paid off 22 trillion roubles of pension arrears last month.\nYeltsin has also vowed to pay off public-sector wage arrears by next year. Many workers have not been paid for months. The federal government owes 7.7 trillion roubles and has promised to help out regional governments, owing 25.6 trillion.\nSome economists say paying the arrears could be inflationary as the recipients desperately need the money for basic goods.\nBut Maelstrom said money supply growth was in line with the central bank's target this year of 10-15 points above inflation.\nM2 money supply on June 1 was 339.4 trillion roubles, rising 15.0 percent since January 1, while consumer prices grew 7.4 percent over the same period.\nInflation slowed to 14.5 percent year-on-year in June. The year-on-year rate has dropped every month since mid-1995, when it was 225 percent. But the rate of decline has slowed recently.\n\"Tight fiscal and monetary policy have done the job of bringing inflation down to 12-14 percent,\" said Maelstrom. \"To get it down further you need to clear out all the problems of non-payments... and that's what the government is doing.\"\nThe improved climate enabled Russia to raise 10-year funds on the international market when it issued its third Eurobond last month. Ministers say improved tax revenues may enable Russia to shelve plans for a further bond this year.\nTreasury bill yields have fallen to record lows below 19 percent and equities rose 30 percent last month to a new record, although they have since slipped  on profit-taking.\nOne obvious black spot is privatisation, which is not as open as it could be. Under pressure to raise revenues quickly, the government is continuing to sell off prime assets under murky conditions, allowing a small group of well-connected banks to get the prime pickings.\nAnother problem area is the failure of gross domestic product to grow. Ministers have repeatedly put back the year when the recovery will start -- it is now seen in 1998 -- and scaled down forecasts for GDP this year.\nThe picture is, however, unclear. Official figures say GDP contracted by a further 0.2 percent year-on-year in the first half of this year, while Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said it grew one percent. The difference depends on how the shadow economy is measured, analysts said.\n\"We're at a turning point, we're certainly not declining any more.

The market has been keen for some time to have a fully-functioning central depository agency to help speed up settlements and encourage investors.\nThe commission said it would put special emphasis on making firms disclose all information relevant to trading to boost investors' confidence.\n\"The securities' comission will try to ensure that investors are given enough information on securities to make their judgments on investments,\" the statement said in one of ten principles laid down by the watchdog.\nOther principles include supervision of public share placements, limiting the number of participants to those that comply with high standards and focusing on issues that could obstruct market development such as takeovers.\n\"The commission does not intend to meddle in each transaction on the market but will of course get involved when the need arises,\" it said.\nThe market watchdog this year established a central register for securities but market participants say it still has yet to start operating fully.\nThe depository is meant to take charge of securities custody and transfer and is also expected to speed up lengthy clearing and settlement. -- Laura Lui, Zagreb Newsroom, 385-1-4557075\n","classes":[13,44,114,115,116,123],"classes_pad":null}

These groups account for 38 percent of the poor,\" Matkovic said.\nThe key factor in the widespread poverty is growing unemployment, which is becoming a long-term problem.\nThere were some 800,000 officially registered jobless persons in 1996.\n\"But what is worrying is that some 55 percent of the unemployed have been waiting for a job for more than three years,\" Matkovic said.\nIn addition to the registered unemployment, there is also widespread underemployment, which is as high as 770,000 in the economic sector -- almost one-half of its total workforce.\nThe growth of underemployment is mainly a result of a government ban on laying off workers and closing down enterprises during the sanctions, Matkovic explained.\n\"Thus the unemployment rate becomes a startling figure, which according to independent estimates ranges from 30 to even close to 50 percent.\"\nBut an estimated 600,000 people classified as unemployed or on paid leave are engaged in the grey economy, which in 1996 accounted for more than 40 percent of the GDP.\nSome 650,000 refugees and other war-affected persons, who took refuge in Yugoslavia, are in a particularly difficult situation.\n\"The most vulnerable categories are the 60,000 refugees and war-affected persons living in collective centres.\"\nAnother endangered group are the elderly and pensioners.\n\"Not only because of low and delayed pensions, which in 1996 stood at an average of some $100 per month, but also because of their inability to gain additional income working in grey economy,\" Matkovic said.\nThe majority of the elderly depend wholly on the public pension fund, whose financial strength has been sapped by long-term insolvency.\nThe extremely difficult economic situation in the country, parting with the previous socialist system, call for both economic and social reforms, the report said.\nMatkovic said revitalisation of the economy required the country's full return to the world community and foreign financial assistance, but this could not happen while the outer wall of sanctions remained in place.\n\"But the reforms are a precondition for removing the outer wall (of sanctions).

{"codes":["C13","C31","C311","CCAT"],"headline":"FEATURE - Russian tea import duty more than storm in tea-cup.","text":"\nThirst for tea in Russia, home to the samovar and one of the world's top tea-consuming nations, could start to dry up because of a government decision to increase import duties.\nMoscow, trying to protect its small tea packaging industry, doubled duties on Russia's packaged tea imports last month.\nBut the industry says the move will be tough to swallow and estimate Russia's demand for tea could slump by as much as 12 percent if retail prices rise the 20-50 percent officials expect.\nFor a cash-strapped population of 180 million, this could prove a cost too far -- even though Russians rank tea alongside bread and potatoes as a basic, essential product.\n\"Ninety-seven percent of Russians drink tea,\" said Igor Lisinenko, head of the Russian Tea Association and chief executive officer of Russia's largest tea importer, the May Company. \"It is a product of mass demand.\"\nA 20 percent duty is now payable on every packet of tea weighing less than three kg (eight lb) arriving in Russia -- double the previous rate. Including value added tax, nearly 40 percent of the price of imported packaged tea goes to duties and taxes.\nA NATIONAL INSTITUTION\nTea, alongside vodka, is Russia's national drink.\n\"Tea has always been our favourite hot drink,\" said Pyotr Kopylov, a driver in the Russian capital. \"We drink it in the morning, offer it to guests, and it rounds off any good party.\"\nThe figures speak for themselves. Association data pegged official imports at around 150,000 tonnes in 1996, second only to Britain, which brought in 180,000 tonnes.\n\"However, analysts estimate that including tea smuggled into Russia, Russia just exceeds Britain,\" the association said.\nIndia is by far the largest supplier, accounting for around 70,000 tonnes in 1996, followed by Sri Lanka, which delivered around 40,000 tonnes last year. Indonesia and China were well behind at 7,000 and 6,000 tonnes, respectively.\nWith annual world tea production around 2.5 million, Russia imports around seven percent of global output.\nRussia does have its own tea growing region in Krasnodar on the Black Sea, but output there last year was a paltry 18,800 tonnes, down sharply from 28,200 tonnes in 1995.\nDUTY HIKE STARTS TO HURT\nThe duty hike is already filtering through to some shops and wholesale markets, while others are holding retail prices at old rates, possibly taking a cut in profits in order to maintain sales volumes.\n\"In many Russian shops -- in fact in the majority -- packaged tea prices have risen (as a result of the duty),\" said Vladimir Perekrest, a May Company spokesman.\nHe said prices at Moscow's giant Marinsky wholesale market had already risen by seven percent. In the Vladimir region to the east of Moscow, shop prices are up 10-12 percent.\nBut at others outlets prices remain unchanged so far.\n\"At the moment we have not noticed any increase in prices for tea packaged abroad,\" said Galina Pavlova, a saleswoman in a major Moscow retail tea store, Tea-Coffee.\nThe shop, with its decaying Chinese-style facade, is still bustling with customers of all generations carefully selecting teas and coffees in a quitessentially Russian ritual.\nRussians have no doubt that any significant rise in prices will be enough to knock down demand for the national drink.\n\"The duty increase is very important,\" Pavlova said. \"Basically, we have a lot of old and unemployed people in our shop, so of course it will affect demand if prices go up by as much as the trading companies are saying.\"\nThe Russian Tea Association estimates prices for cheaper brands could rise by 30 to 50 percent as a result of the duty increase, while more expensive brands could rise by a more modest but still significant 20 to 30 percent.\n\"I would definitely drink less tea if prices went up that amount,\" Kopylov said.\nPROTECTING DOMESTIC INDUSTRY\nOne of the main aims of the import duty increase is to protect Russia's small and struggling tea packaging industry. Import tariffs on unpacked tea have not risen, giving bulk importers who then package tea within Russia the upper hand.\nMay's Lisinenko said the move was discriminatory and would lead to a fall in the quality of tea that trading companies like his have managed to provide since economic reforms began six years ago.\n\"In 1991 and 1992, there was practically no choice,\" he said. \"We have secured tea for Russians and have ensured competition in the market.\"\nRussian tea packagers, like the Nikitin tea company, may stand to benefit from the tariff hike.\nNikitin's director of marketing, Anton Derlyatka, said such drastic measures were needed to shore up Russia's packers.\n\"At the moment, our industry costs are 7.5 times higher than those of packaged-tea importers,\" he said. \"The main thing is to create fair competition between domestic packagers and importing companies.\"\nTEA INDUSTRY WATCHING THREAT FROM COFFEE\nRussia's tea industry is aware any rise in tea prices could be a boon for Russia's budding coffee industry.\nSupermarkets in Moscow are full of a wide range of instant and fresh-ground coffees, and the number of Russian roasting companies is on the rise. The market is still small compared to tea, but the potential for growth is seen by some as strong.\nBut coffee prices also rose sharply on the international markets earlier this year, hitting bean and instant coffee prices around the world.\n\"I don't think people will drink more coffee if tea prices go up,\" May's Perekrest said. \"Instant coffee prices have gone up by 20-25 percent this year and tea is still cheaper.\"\n\"Tea is the cheapest of the two, and considering the income level of most of the population, there is not much room for consumption of coffee to rise until there is a substantial increase in individuals' incomes,\" said a Moscow-based tea industry source.\n","classes":[13,33,34,44],"classes_pad":null}

Burrillo made no effort to play things down, telling the Wall Street Journal recently that Canedo \"doesn't have any experience in finance and should be gone.\"\nBut on Wall Street, Canedo had earned a reputation as the man who helped Televisa weather Mexico's 1994-5 financial crisis. A year before Mexico's peso crashed and caused the price of dollar debt here to double, Canedo engineered one of the largest private bank loans in Mexico's history for the company -- in pesos.\nTelevisa's stock price suffered in recent weeks partly due to the uncertainty. On Monday, Televisa's shares on the Mexican bourse fell 5.75 percent mainly on worries about the company's management troubles and its upcoming quarterly earnings report.\nCompany officials on Monday played down Canedo's departure, stressing that the remainder of Televisa's team was intact.\n\"We cannot hide the fact there were differences between the two men, although I do not know how much they played a role (in Canedo's exit),\" company spokesman Xavier Von Bertrab told Reuters.\n\"The important thing is that the company's plans ... remain intact. We have made commitments to the marketplace and we will carry them out,\" Von Bertrab added, referring to the company's recent Televisa 2000 plan to cut costs and revamp programming.\nAnalysts said earlier on Monday the company might get a boost once its management saga drew to a close.\n\"It might be a positive for the company ... people there haven't had much time in the past few months to focus on the core business,\" said one company analyst in New York.\nThe company said it was continuing its search for a chief financial officer and named Raul Lopez Martinez to serve in the role in the interim.\nVon Bertrab said about four or five candidates were currently under consideration, including the chief financial officer at Mexican retailer Cifra SA, Gilberto Perezalonso.\n","classes":[41,42,44],"classes_pad":null}

Four other members of the Paoletti family were arrested.\nFamily members of one suspected Paoletti victim, 22-year-old deaf-mute Ismael Santiago Garcia, said he was persuaded by a Paoletti to travel to the United States and trusted the man as an honest benefactor.

Inflation was 11.8 percent.\n\"The situation has not gathered sufficient strength to warrant a change in outlook,\" agreed Romary.  \nUBS currently forecasts 9.0 percent inflation and $1.8 billion trade deficit for 1997. A growth forecast of 3.6 percent is likely to be revised upwards shortly on the basis of new economic data, Romary said.\n\"Opposition (to Fujimori) while growing, is still not strong enough to push him out of office,\" Romary said.\nWith recent polls showing unemployment and low salaries still topping Peruvians' main concerns ahead of press freedom and abuses by security forces, Fujimori may be tempted to announce public sector salary rises and increased spending.  \nBut a fiscal surplus equivalent to about 2.5 percent of GDP means, \"the government has a much wider margin to implement such measures without adversely affecting the economy,\" said Guillermo Arbe, head of research at Morgan Grenfell in Lima.\nAnd while investors have grown accustomed to associating Peru's economic program with the 58-year-old son of Japanese immigrants, the reforms Fujimori has implemented now have the backing of a large cross-section of society.\n\"Even if Fujimori doesn't stand in 2000, the economic model is not questioned by anybody,\" Secada said.\n((-- Lima newsroom, 511 221-2134))\n","classes":[45,46,64,65,70,90,104],"classes_pad":null}

Lepe, for example, worked with injured combatants recuperating in Mexico.\nMany of the former rebels were ambivalent about the future. Alberto Aguilar, a Mam Indian, comforted his teenage son, Samuel, who wept upon leaving his community in Chiapas, Mexico, for a homeland he has never known.\nThe Aguilar family, which lost two sons to the war, fled Concepcion Chiquirichapa in the western highlands of Guatemala 13 years ago at the height of the army's counterinsurgency campaign in the countryside.\nAguilar was uncertain how they would be received when they returned.\n\"We hear bad reports,\" he said.\nThe rebel resettlement process is proving painful in rural communities that bore the brunt of the 36-year civil war.\nThe indigenous hamlets of the highlands were devastated by the scorched-earth counterinsurgency tactics of the previous decade, which razed as many as 440 villages across Guatemala.\nAn estimated 100,000 people died and 40,000 disappeared in the armed conflict.\nEarlier this year, in the northern Ixcan jungle, members of a farming cooperative, themselves repatriated refugees, violently rejected demobilizing rebels who had been their neighbours.\n\"There are resentments,\" said Cesar Sanchez, a resident of Concepcion Chiquirichapa who remained in the village throughout the war.

Cargill's spokesman in Brazil last week dismissed the talk but was not immediately available for comment on the fresh rumors.\nMeanwhile, a spokesman for Ceval said the company's position was unchanged since last week, when it replied to enquiries by saying there was no truth to the talk.\n\"Ceval is an open company whose shares are traded. When the deal is done, it will happen in the market,\" he added. But he declined to say if such a deal was imminent.\nTalk of the purchase drove Ceval's shares up 3.02 percent to 12.98 reais (US$12.01) by 1110 local\/1410 GMT but shares subsequently eased to 12.90 reais by midday.\nAlthough the Sao Paulo stock exchange said it had received no communique from Ceval, traders said the market was assuming the purchase was virtually concluded.\n\"I heard that within the company (Cargill), officially nothing's happened but unofficially it's a done deal,\" said one soybean trader with contacts at Cargill.\n\"We heard talk from a bank that Cargill's auditors were at Ceval and Ceval's bigwigs have gone to the States, so obviously something is going on,\" said a broker.\nCeval is Brazil's largest processor, owning 12 factories in Brazil and one in Argentina, with a total crushing capacity of 15,880 tonnes per day, according to Brazilian Association of Vegetable Oils Industries (Abiove).\nCeval's dominant participation in the local soy market would allow Cargill to counter ADM's recent purchase of Glencore Grain Holding's grain handling facilities in Brazil and Paraguay, analysts said.\nIn addition, Ceval is vulnerable to a take-over due to its net debt to equity ratio of 83 percent in December 1996, according to Caspian Securities analyst Lilyanna Yang.\n\"Big grain firms are looking at future strategic positions in Latin America because there's only a finite area within which you can increase in the U.S.,\" said Michael McDougall, director of commodities futures at Fimat Futures.\n\"With local firms still suffering from the high debt load they've run up and the ICMS tax cut, obviously crushing firms are suffering and vulnerable to large firms snapping them up,\" he added.\nThe abolition of the ICMS export tax last year made it more profitable to export soybeans rather than soymeal or soyoil, bringing down exports of soyproducts and forcing crushers to compete heavily for raw material.\nGlencore's option agreement to buy 51 percent of major Argentine oilseed crusher Oleaginosa Moreno SA was evidence of strong outside interest in the region, traders said.\nADM was said to be considering buying Caramuru Oleos Vegetais, which has two factories with a capacity of 1,500 tonnes each in Goias state, as well as Olvepar, a crusher in Parana with capacity of 1,500 tonnes a day.\nBunge y Born was also said to be shopping around for a Brazilian crusher, possibly Olvepar.\nCaramuru was seen as an attractive buy because it has a plant in Sao Simao on the Tiete-Parana river highway. But a spokesman for the company said he knew of no take-over.\nWaterways in the west and north of Brazil are set to revolutionize Brazil's soybean map as growers take advantage of the cost savings offered by river over road transport to experiment planting soybeans in new states, including Amazonas.\n\"The waterways in the north-west have the potential to increase production by up to 10 million hectares,\" said McDougall.

Imports of $4.654 billion in 1996 were almost double the previous year, while exports last year totalled $3.385 billion.\n\"Export growth has been very difficult to achieve and defend,\" Trade Ministry official Humberto Jasso Torres said at Monday's general assembly of the National Farm Council (CNA).\nThe CNA estimates agricultural imports from its NAFTA parnters will climb to $6.3 billion in 1997, compared to exports of $4.8 billion in agriculture trade with the United States and Canada.\nAgriculture officials cited continuing trade restrictions, such as the U.S. ban on Mexico's pork and wheat, as holding back potential export growth.\nNAFTA countries have sneaked around one another's trade quotas and unjustly protected products, CNA vice president Eugenio Salinas Morales said. He said Mexico has fulfilled its side of the agreement while the United States and Canada have delayed their commitments.\n\"We've seen failures in the administration of quotas, late activation of safeguards and an excess in imports in tariff-free quotas,\" he said. \"Our exports, in contrast with our imports, have stayed practically the same since before the treaty.\"\nMexican imports of oil seeds and grains more than doubled in 1996 from the time of NAFTA's beginnings in 1993. Oil seeds imports were $1.094 billion in 1996, and Mexico's outside purchases of grains such as corn, wheat and sorghum reached $1.954 billion.\nMeanwhile, Mexico's exports of livestock grew at a slower rate of some 20 percent in the three-year time period, and fruit and vegetable exports rose about 30 percent.\nNAFTA negotiations slowly have made inroads in allowing Mexican tomato, avocado and pork exports into the U.S. markets. These products had been barred from the United States for decades on phytosanitary disputes.\nBut on April 9, the United States agreed to allow Mexican avocados in 19 states, beginning in November. Mexico's Sonora state was declared free of hog cholera and able to begin exporting to the U.S. last month.\nThe Trade Ministry's Jasso said negotiations last week could open regional Mexican wheat exports, which have been blocked for 20 years to the United States.\n\"I said from the start that NAFTA would affect part of the sector and also today we are beginning to open doors and boost exports,\" Agriculture Secretary Francisco Labastida said.\nAgricultural business leaders, however, have not been so patient for freer trade.\n\"Now we want to see the pork export ban extended to other producing states like Yucatan, Chihuahua, Nuevo Leon and Sinaloa. We want to see the opening included to other products that are blocked,\" he said.\nSalinas faulted Mexican producers for not marketing better their products in other markets and not defending them enough against protectionism.\n\"We need to be ready to counteract baseless public campaigns that cover inefficiency for products that cannot compete in a free market,\" he said.\nAgriculture business leaders hailed trade talks with South America and Europe as a means of diffusing export dependence from NAFTA partners. About 83 percent of Mexico's agriculture exports from 1994 to 1996 went to the United States and Canada.\n((--Mexico City newsroom +525 728-7903))\n","classes":[33,44,64,66,70],"classes_pad":null}

It bounced from this oversold position but could well return to those 18-month lows if today's data are as weak as some expect.  \nUnderlying inflation is expected to rise 0.4 percent on the quarter taking annual growth to just 1.7 percent, the lowest level in 27 years and crucially below the RBA's target band of 2-3 percent. Headline CPI should fall 0.1 peercent leaving the annual rate at 0.5 percent from 1.3 percent in Q1.\nAnalysts reckon the RBA would be hard pressed not to cut in the face of such favourable numbers and, as long as wages data Thursday were as benign as expected, could move Friday morning.\nThe crucial question for the A$ would be how much of the easing had the market already priced in.

Kekst & Co has been working for the Swiss Bankers Association.\nThe long-awaited list covers names and details of accounts opened by foreigners before the end of World War Two in 1945 and whose owners have not been heard from in at least 10 years.\nThese criteria mean the tally could include accounts whose owners dropped out of contact for other reasons than the Holocaust.\nA second list will follow in October with dormant pre-1945 accounts opened by Swiss residents, who may have acted as proxies to hide away the assets of European Jews and others threatened by the Nazis.\nSwiss banks are breaking with their tradition of secrecy in an effort to calm criticism led by the World Jewish Congress (WJC) that the banks withheld fortunes in accounts left by victims of the Holocaust. The banks deny hoarding dormant assets.\nThe controversy is separate from the issue of Nazi gold, which the Swiss central bank bought during the war. Critics say the Swiss laundered gold looted by the Nazis, but the Swiss National Bank says it did not know at the time the gold was stolen.\nThe list and details of the claims procedure will also be available on the Internet, with the address of the site to be made public at a news conference on Wednesday, Matile said.\nThe news conference was moved from the originally scheduled site in the capital Berne to Zurich airport.\nAlong with Swiss Bankers Association presdient Georg Krayer, the news conference will include Israel Singer, secretary general of the World Jewish Congress.\nFormer U.S. central bank chairman Paul Volcker will also be there in his capacity as head of an independent commission set up by the WJC and Swiss banks to scour bank records for traces of Holocaust accounts.\n","classes":[13,15,16,37,44,90,93],"classes_pad":null}

That would see the TWI stabilising around 64 in late 1997 and 90-day bank bills rates gradually returning from over 8.5 percent to 7.5 percent by mid-1998.\nThe fall in the New Zealand dollar will be insufficient to substantially raise manufactured export growth rates and will be skewed towards domestic activity, DNG predicts.\nThe current account deficit will worsen to above 5 percent of GDP from 4.8 percent at March 1997.  \nUnder the analysis, fiscal surpluses -- estimated by Treasury at $1.5-2.6 billion in the next three years -- would evaporate, implying the debt\/GDP ratio would stall at 27 percent and bond issuance of around $1.8 billion in 1997\/98 and $3.5 billion in each of the following two year be required.\nSchoefisch forecast a significant decline in the underlying inflation rate though 1997 and into 1998, with the annual rate hovering near the midpoint of the RB's 0-3 percent target range.\n-- Wellington newsroom 64 4 4734 746\ne-mail wellington.newsroom@reuters.com\n","classes":[46,70],"classes_pad":null}

Given the impressive rally in Australian bonds this year, and ahead of what is expected to be a market friendly second quarter inflation result, economists were asked where they saw the 10-year bond yield at the end of 1997 and what the yield spread to the U.S. would be.  \nTEN-YEAR YIELD - The median expectation is for a year-end yield of 7.05 percent which compares with this week's 3-1\/2 year low of around 6.50 percent, although forecasts were fairly wide ranging from 6.25 to 8.0 percent.\nThe performance of the market this year so far has outpaced all expectations and largely reflects the failure of the economy to pick up, which is keeping unemployment stuck around 8.5 percent, and an extremely benign inflation outlook.\nThe market has a further 50 basis points monetary policy easing priced in.  \nIn the main, economists expect this additional stimulus to help growth pick up towards the end of the year, which in turn will start raising questions about inflation and the possibility of the Reserve Bank reversing its easing bias next year.\nAt the start of the year, economists had expected an end-1997 level of 8.0 percent with forecasts ranging from 6.75 to 8.60 percent.\nTEN-YEAR SPREAD - Median expectations for the spread centre on a 50 basis point margin over the U.S. by year-end, up from around 40 basis points at present, but again forecasts were wide, from a positive spread of 120 b.p. to a negative 50 b.p.  \nFor the same reasons that yields may go higher, so will the spread, although economists generally expect the margin can go tighter and possibly negative before it reverses the trend.\nHowever, one investment bank expects the spread to breach parity and stay there with the market outperforming a declining U.S. Treasury market on Australia's far superior inflation outlook.\nLike yields, the market's outperformance had exceeded expectations with a poll of economists at the beginning of the year showing a median expectation of a 140 basis point spread and in a forecast range of 40 to 225 b.p.  \nCol State    -0.2   +0.4   +0.3   +1.6   +0.9   +4.1  +15.0\nComm Bank    -0.2   +0.3   +0.3   +1.7   +0.8   +4.0   +5.0\nCounty\t flat   +0.6   +0.4   +1.6   +0.9   +4.1    n\/a\nDMG\t    -0.3   +0.3   +0.5   +1.9   +0.7   +3.9  +14.0\nDresdner     flat   +0.6   +0.4   +1.7   +0.9   +4.1   +4.0\nGIO\t    +0.1   +0.7   +0.5   +1.8   +0.8   +4.1   +2.2\nHSBC\t   -0.2   +0.4   +0.5   +1.8   +1.0   +4.2  +11.0\nJP Morgan    -0.2   +0.4   +0.35  +1.7   +0.8   +4.0  +10.0\nMacquarie    +0.1   +0.7   +0.5   +1.8    n\/a    n\/a  +10.0\nMerrills     -0.1   +0.5   +0.2   +1.5   +0.9   +4.1   +6.0\nNAB\t    -0.2   +0.4   +0.4   +1.7   +0.7   +4.0    n\/a\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\t   HEADLINE\tUNDERLYING\tAWOTE    REGOS\n\t\t   Q2  Q2\/Q2     Q2  Q2\/Q2     Q2  Q2\/Q2\nAccess\t  +0.1  +0.7   +0.5   +1.7   +1.1   +4.4    n\/a\nAMP\t     -0.2  +0.3   +0.3   +1.7   +0.7   +3.9  +10.0\nANZ Bank\t-0.3  +0.3   +0.3   +1.6   +0.8   +4.0  +12.5\nANZ Secs\t-0.3  +0.3   +0.4   +1.7   +0.8   +4.0  +13.0\nAxiom\t   -0.1  +0.5   +0.4   +1.8   +0.9   +4.1    n\/a\nBT\t\t-0.2  +0.5   +0.5   +1.8   +1.0   +4.2   +2.0\nBZW\t     +0.1  +0.7   +0.6   +1.9   +0.9   +4.1   +1.0\nCitibank\tflat  +0.6   +0.4   +1.7   +1.0   +4.2   +8.0\nNat Mutual    flat  +0.6   +0.3   +1.6   +0.6   +3.8   +2.0\nNomura\t  -0.1  +0.5   +0.3   +1.6   +0.8   +4.0    n\/f\nPru Bache     -0.1  +0.5   +0.3   +1.6   +0.8   +4.1    n\/f\nRothschild    -0.2  +0.4   +0.3   +1.6   +1.0   +4.2   +3.0\nSBC\t     -0.2  +0.4   +0.2   +1.5   +0.8   +4.0  +12.0\nSoc Gen\t -0.1  +0.5   +0.3   +1.7   +0.9   +4.2   +2.5\nUBS\t     +0.3  +0.9   +0.4   +1.7   +0.8   +4.0   +5.0\nWestpac\t +0.1  +0.7   +0.5   +1.8   +0.8   +4.1   +8.0\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n    Low\t-0.3   +0.2    +0.2   +1.5    +0.6   +3.8     +1.0\n    High     +0.3   +0.9    +0.6   +1.9    +1.1   +4.4    +15.0\n    Average  -0.1   +0.5    +0.4   +1.7    +0.9   +4.1     +7.4\n    Median   -0.1   +0.5    +0.4   +1.7    +0.8   +4.1     +8.0\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\t 10-YEAR BONDS AT END OF 1997\n\t\t  yield    spread\t\t yield    spread\nAccess\t   7.10\t50     Merrills   7.25\t+50\nAMP\t\t7.75\t90     NAB\t  7.25\t+50\nANZ Bank\t 7.00\t50     Nomura     7.0\t +30\nANZ Secs\t 7.40\t50     Pru Bache  6.25\t+25\nAxiom\t    7.25\t75     Rothschild 7.5\t +80\nBT\t\t 7.25-7.50 50     SBC\t  7.10\t+10\nBZW\t\t7.20     +70     Soc Gen    6.85\t+20\nCitibank\t 7.00     +50     UBS\t  7.0\t +40\nCol State\t6.90     +30     Westpac    6.5\tflat\nComm Bank\t8.00    +120\t\t    6.75\t-50\nHigh\t     8.00    +120     Dresdner   6.75     flat\nAverage\t  7.10     +42     HSBC\t 7.0\t+20\nMedian\t   7.05     +50     JP Morgan   NF\t+40\n\t\t\t\t\t  Macquarie  7.5\t+50\n---------------------------------------------------------\nINFLATION - Forecasts for the June quarter consumer price index have moderated slightly over the past week, with economists saying petrol prices were the main reason behind the slight lowering of forecasts, although this was offset by some rises in fresh fruit and vegetables, with potatoes singled out for special mention. The negative 0.1 percent forecasts compares with a flat expectation last week. If the CPI is negative, it will be the first quarter of deflation since June 1992, and the lowest annual rate since the year to December quarter 1992.  \nThe underlying rate of inflation is expected to fall to its lowest annual level since the series inception in the early 1970's. If the quarterly result comes in as forecast, it will mean that in five out of the last six quarters, underlying inflation has been 0.5 percent or less.\nWAGES - Average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) is expected to have post its lowest quarterly rise in over one year. That will see the annual rate moderate from the February quarter's 4.3 percent, and further away from the level seen as the RBA's speed limit on wages, 4.5 percent.  \nCombined with the inflation forecasts, the data is expectred to be very bullish for those looking for a fifth interest rate cut -- with the two favoured days being Friday, after both sets of data, or August 6, after the next RBA board meeting.\nNEW MOTOR VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS - A rebound is expected for June after two soft months, with strong industry data released earlier this month behind many of the larger forecasts. Generally the data is expected to be lost in the aftermath of the wages and inflation figures.  \n-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800\n","classes":[69,70],"classes_pad":null}

Such a vehicle would ideally run on natural gas or other suitable combustible fuels.\nPower Beat has designed what it says is the world's first fully extruded internal combustion engine and parallel research led the company to developing a new exhaust scrubbing technology for motor vehicles. It says the technology was capable of producing zero emissions.  \nThe scrubber captures exhaust particles, including carbon and nitrogen, using continuously cycled water. The water includes certain biodegradable catalysts and is screened through paper filters.\nThe company says tests show hydrocarbon emissions were reduced to 31 parts per million, half that of conventional catalytic converters, and to zero parts per million when used in series with an existing catalytic converter.\nAfter up to eight hours of driving, or each time a vehicle needs refuelling, the paper filter cartridge is removed and dropped into a compost bin.  \nA new filter is then clipped into the vehicle's scrubber.\nThe company says the resultant fertiliser can then be sold to farmers or gardeners.\nIt says changing filters can take about 30 seconds and costs up to $1 per filter.\nPower Beat intends licensing the technology.\nThe company is running a standard 1600cc van with one of the prototype exhaust scrubbers. A retrofit version is under development for some vehicle types such as taxis, buses and service vehicles. The company is also studying a process to allow automatic loading and unloading of the paper filter.  \n\"The addition of fragrances to the scrubber catalyst adds a pleasant smell,\" said Witehira.\n\"We can provide any scent such as apple, lemon or even Chanel No 5 to add a touch of class to the clean exhaust discharge.\"\n-- Wellington newsroom 64 4 4734 746\n-- e-mail wellington.newsroom@reuters.com\n","classes":[31,44,90,97,107],"classes_pad":null}

But a senior ASEAN source said officials have left any decision to the foreign ministers.\n\"The situation is unsettled. It's difficult to say what will happen,\" the source said.\nAsked if Cambodia might be included on Wednesday, he said: \"I doubt it very much, it's kind of late, it's quite unlikely\".\nASEAN foreign ministers' deliberations on Cambodia will lean heavily on the report offered by a contingent of foreign ministers from Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines who recently met separately with Hun Sen, Ranariddh and Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk.\n\"Tomorrow will be the opportunity for us to discuss the issue...at the same time, we will have the opportunity to hear from the ASEAN mission (comprising the three foreign ministers),\" Abdullah said.\nThe ministers' meeting also comes as the United States attempts to play a role in solving the crisis.\nPresident Clinton's special envoy on Cambodia, former congressman Stephen Solarz, is due to meet Abdullah on Wednesday morning.\nU.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will hold a one-on-one session with Abdullah on Saturday when she attends the ASEAN Regional Forum, which includes countries that have a running dialogue with the grouping.\nThe United States has expressed its disapproval of ASEAN's inclusion of Burma into its fold because of the country's human rights record.\nAbdullah, as host of the ASEAN conference this year, found himself still defending the group's decision to admit Burma.\nQuestioned by reporters about the benefit of embracing Burma as a member, Abdullah said Burma would broaden ASEAN's market adding, \"the decision to admit Myanmar (Burma) was one of consensus\".\nAsked why ASEAN did not consider delaying Burma's entry as it had Cambodia's, Abdullah said: \"There was no guarantee that by waiting everything would be better\".\n","classes":[90,93],"classes_pad":null}

But Hun Sen's coup against Ranariddh put that plan on hold.\nOn Tuesday it began a last ditch effort to join ASEAN on the eve of the regional group's induction of Laos and Burma.\nDespite saying publicly that it could do without joining the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), Cambodia requested that it be included with the other two countries as originally scheduled.\nForeign Minister Ung Huot, who has been nominated by the remants of the royalist party in Phnom Penh to replace Ranariddh as first prime minister, was due to fly to Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday to attend the ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting as an observer.\nHowever,  some ASEAN officials say that the effort seemed unlikely to succeed.\nThe United States said last week it would not recognise Ung Huot as first prime minister and U.S. envoy Stephen Solarz was due in Phnom Penh on Thursday, the U.S. Embassy said.\nSolarz, formerly a key player in U.S. policy in the region, will try to develop a \"coherent initiative\" on Cambodia in talks with Asian leaders this week, a U.S. State Department spokesman said earlier.\n","classes":[90,93,110],"classes_pad":null}

It later eased back to 711.44 points, down 0.13 percent at the close on late profit-taking.\nThe index fell 1.6 percent to 712.40 points on Monday as rupiah panic spilled over to the stock market.\n\"It's a volatile day. In general the market has not stabilised yet, but it's better than Monday,\" a currency dealer in Singapore said. The dealer added that there were already customers looking to short the U.S. currency at the 2,600 rupiah level.\nThe rupiah made the largest single-day loss on Monday by plummeting almost five percent to 2,665 against the dollar before recovering slightly to 2,640 at the close.\nThe plunge was larger than when the market was hit by nervousness in July last year over the health of President Suharto and riots in Jakarta.\nHowever, the rupiah recovered with ease on both those occasions, reflecting offshore confidence in Indonesia. But the confidence was shaken in recent weeks after speculative attacks on regional currencies forced devaluations in the Thai baht and the Philippine peso.\nEconomists said the attack on the rupiah had nothing to do with economic fundamentals and represented a contagion effect.\n\"This wave of contagion hitting the regional currencies will be a relatively long-running affair. The danger is that this is a temporary calm we're seeing,\" said Desmond Supple, head of Asian currency research at BZW Asia.\nSupple said a meeting of Asian central bankers in Shanghai later in the week could yield strong verbal support for the region's currencies, but he added that he did not expect it to result in coordinated intervention.\nCurrency dealers said there was a lot of profit-taking in dollars at the opening, pushing the dollar down to the 2,600 level. It tumbled to a low of 2,570 after the central bank intervened, which triggered stop-loss selling in dollars.\n\"The market was looking for signals and directions from the central bank. The bank intervention gave a very good signal in the market and it took the signal by selling dollars down,\" Edwin Png, country treasurer of Bank of America, told Reuters.\nShort-covering helped the dollar recover, but it was still below the psychologically important level of 2,600.\n\"The market is quite reluctant to buy (the dollar) up too high. Anything above the 2,600 level, I think the market is willing to go short again,\" Png said.\nFinance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said on Tuesday the government had no plans to alter monetary policy in the wake of the speculative attack on the rupiah.\nMar'ie said he was confident the market would improve on the back of the country's sound economic fundamentals.\nHe said turmoil in the currency market was speculative and it could not continue for long because speculation implied a hit-and-run strategy.\n","classes":[116,118,123],"classes_pad":null}

The company's growth stalled this year because of delays in introducing new products, inefficient operations split between the East and West coasts, and tougher competition against bigger rivals like Cisco Systems Inc.\nLate last yeaar, Bay Networks hired David House, a senior executive from Intel Corp., to trim its operations and come up with new product strategies.\nAnalysts said House has done a good job of shoring up the company in a few short months.\n\"He has an understanding of the basics of blocking and tackling at the company, like holding people accountable and forcing the company to make tough decisions on picking product development,\" said Noel Lindsey, networking analyst at investment bank Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. The company had lost much of its momentum, Lindsey said, because no one was held accountable for late products or slow development.\n\"The revenue growth will happen sequentially in coming quarters as we introduce new products,\" House said in an interview. \"We think, based on the stregth of our product line, we'll (have a) modest increase in revenue\" in the traditionally weak September quarter, he said.\nBay said shipments of one of its new products, the BayStack 350T switch, \"significantly exceeded\" the company's expectations.

Two alleged accomplices, Jose Medina, 51, and Boris Sabas, 42, were also named defendants in the case.\nClosing arguments in the case concluded on Tuesday and U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones will instruct jurors in the law on Wednesday to be followed by deliberations.\nProsecutors had introduced as evidence recorded telephone conversations and letters in which Jackson contacted Cosby's lawyer, his publisher, CBS and Cosby's television sponsors, and threatened to expose the actor as a deadbeat dad unless she received money.\nDuring closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Engelmayer alleged Jackson threatened to ruin Cosby's reputation \"over and over again\" and showed that she was \"ready, willing and able\" to take her story to the news media.\n\"She was an extortionist driven by greed,\" he said.\nAs part of the scheme, Jackson provided Cosby's lawyer and the former president of CBS with an unsigned contract with the Globe supermarket tabloid in which she would sell her story for $25,000.\nEnglemayer said the fact that the contract was unsigned made it a threat with the message \"I'm one signature away from ruining your reputation.\"\n\"The defendants did not want to get money the old fashioned way by working. They wanted to get rich quick,\" Engelmayer told the Manhattan federal jury.\nBut Jackson's lawyer Robert Baum described Jackson as \"naive\" and a \"petulant child\" who desperately needed money to survive. He said she was caught in a moral dilemma of selling her life story to a tabloid or getting money from the man she believed to be her father.\n\"She did not possess any intent to extort,\" Baum said. \"What Autumn Jackson really needed in January 1997 was love ... she needed guidance.\"\nHe alleged that Cosby paid Jackson's family to keep his fatherhood secret and said the case was really a story of \"betrayal, abandonment, deceit and manipulation.\"\nJones previously ruled that Cosby's paternity was irrelevant to the case and said the real issue was whether the defendants committed extortion. Cosby testified he had sex once with Jackson's mother, Shawn Thompson, but denied being her father.\n","classes":[90,91],"classes_pad":null}

Cunanan, America's most wanted man, is also a suspect in four killings in northern U.S. states since April.\nNew Hampshire is virtually the entire length of the United States from the southeastern state of Florida, where Cunanan is wanted in connection with the shooting of Versace to death outside his Miami Beach mansion on July 15.\nLebanon, near Boston, is also about three hours by car from the U.S.-Canadian border.\nPolice searched the Lebanon area for more than two hours but were unable to find either the car or the suspect.\nCanadian police in Vancouver, British Columbia, said earlier on Tuesday that Cunanan had spent time in the city last summer but there was no sign he had been there recently.\nHundreds of people think they might have spotted Cunanan but a week after the slaying of Versace, he was still at large, considered armed and dangerous by authorities.\nThe FBI confirmed on Tuesday that the gun that killed Versace was the same weapon used in two other murders allegedly committed by Cunanan.\nBallistics tests showed the bullets that killed an architect in Minnesota and a gravedigger in New Jersey came from the same .40 calibre handgun used in Versace's murder, Minnesota FBI spokeswoman Coleen Rowley said.\nAs superstar friends of Versace attended a memorial mass in Milan, Italy, investigators in Miami and the FBI in Washington sifted through hundreds of tips phoned in on two special murder hotlines.\nCunanan, 27 described by police as a homosexual prostitute, is wanted in a total of four murders before Versace's including that of his former male lover.\nPolice said over the weekend that he is a master of disguise who may be dressing as a woman to avoid capture.\nAccording to calls to police, he has variously been seen playing darts in a Miami Beach bar, hanging out on the beach or mingling with crowds of mourners and gawkers outside Versace's mansion.\n\"However none of the sightings reported since the homicide have been confirmed,\" police said in a statement.\nVersace was shot twice in the head by a lone gunman as he walked back to his oceanfront mansion in Miami Beach's fashionable Art Deco South Beach neighbourhood.\nCunanan, for whom a $45,000 reward has been offered, is the only suspect.\nLocal television in Miami said Tuesday that police were checking records at a Miami Beach library.\nPolice believed Cunanan borrowed a book by an author whose other work includes a novel about a homosexual love triangle at Italy's Lake Como, where Versace kept a house and where his ashes were placed in a vault last week.\nThe victims in the murders allegedly carried out with the same gun were David Madson, a Minnesota architect, and William Reese, a gravedigger in New Jersey. The two other killings in which Cunanan is the suspect were committed with a claw hammer and a gardening tool.\nThe FBI meanwhile said it had no evidence suggesting Cunanan ever visited Versace's Miami home.\nSome reports have said the FBI had photographic evidence placing Cunanan at Versace's house prior to the murder.\nThe relationship, if any existed at all, between the two men is not known. But Vanity Fair magazine, which was preparing a profile on Cunanan before Versace's killing, said they were casually acquainted.\n","classes":[90,91],"classes_pad":null}

Tuesday introduced a new operating system for the Macintosh personal computer, the most significant Mac operating system upgrade since 1984.\nSeparately, Apple announced it hired Heidrick & Struggles Inc., an executive search firm, to help find a successor to former Chairman and Chief Executive Gilbert Amelio.\nThe troubled computer maker said it could take about 90 days to find a successor for Amelio, who stepped down earlier this month amid concerns that sales were not growing fast enough.\nThe Mac OS 8, a new version of the basic software that controls the Macintosh computer, is expected to generate much-needed revenues for Apple as Macintosh users upgrade their software.\nApple said in a statement that Mac OS 8 also represents the latest milestone in the company's dual strategy of delivering Mac OS updates as well as Rhapsody, the code name for Apple's next-generation operating system.\nMac OS 8 includes new features and technologies aimed at improving productivity and efficiency, simplifying Internet access and providing state-of-the-art multimedia capabilities.\n\"The depth of Internet capabilities in Mac OS 8, along with a dramatically improved user experience ... and industry-leading multimedia technologies will delight Macintosh customers,\" said Avie Tevanian, senior vice president for software engineering.\nIncluded with Mac OS 8 are Netscape Navigator 3.01 and Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.01 for browsing the World Wide Web. It also uses the latest so-called push technologies, such as PointCast Network and Marimba's Castanet Tuner, which allow data to be sent to desktop machines without users having to search the Internet for it.\nThe PointCast Network in Mac OS 8 will include an Apple channel that notifies Mac users about breaking Apple-related news stories, software updates, new product announcements, customer support news, and other special information.\nAs a starting point for Internet exploration, Apple has collaborated with Web search firm Excite to provide data delivery and Internet navigation services in Mac OS 8.\nMac OS 8 is expected to be available in the United States and Canada on Saturday. The estimated retail price for Mac OS 8 in the United States is $99 for the CD-ROM version. Current Mac OS 7.6. or Mac OS 7.6.1 owners will be eligible for a $30 rebate, bringing the upgrade for those customers to $69.\nMac OS 8 will be made available for purchase on CD-ROM only, but customers may request a floppy disk version of Mac OS 8 after buying the CD-ROM version by returning a coupon included inside the box. Customers who want the diskette version will have to pay an additional $25 plus shipping, handling and sales tax.\n","classes":[30,41,42,44],"classes_pad":null}

We believe this pope who has recognised Israel and condemned anti-Semitism will rise above petty bureaucrats who seek to obscure the truth.\"\nA&E, a cable television network, said it came across the document during research for a two-hour documentary, \"Blood Money: Switzerland's Nazi Gold,\" to be broadcast on Saturday.\nThe find marked the first time in a more than a year-long hunt of U.S. national archives by researchers that the Vatican has been mentioned in connection with gold looted by the Nazis or their allies.\nThe previously classified document, dated October 1946, said that pro-Nazi Croatian fascists removed about 350 million Swiss francs from Yugoslavia at the end of the war.\nIn the document, U.S. Treasury Department official Emerson Bigelow wrote to the department's director of monetary research that the British managed to capture only about 150 million.\nHe said a reliable source in Italy had told him the Vatican held the rest and rumours were rife that much of that was later taken through a Vatican pipeline to Spain and Argentina.\nMeawnwhile, other researchers said they had found documents showing that the Vatican City bank had substantial dealings with Swiss banks blacklisted by the Allies for doing business with Germany and its Axis partners.\n","classes":[90,93,104],"classes_pad":null}

He will be in charge of expanding research and spending time on emerging technologies.\nIBM, based in Armonk, N.Y. also said it was creating a new unit that would include the IBM PC Co., the Network Computer unit and the consumer unit because the distinctions among the businesses are blurring. Network computers are low-cost machines meant to operate more cheaply than PCs.\nThis new business unit, which IBM referred to as \"the end-user-oriented group\" will be under Sam Palmisano, 44, who was promoted to senior vice president. Palmisano was most recently general manager of the PC Co. and has been credited with helping build the services business into what is now IBM's fastest-growing unit.\n\"They have rewarded Sam for everything he has done,\" said Sam Albert, a Scarsdale, N.Y.-based industry consultant. \"He is being asked to straighten out the confusion and make sense of it all,\" he said, referring to the blurring lines between consumer PCs, low-cost corporate PCs and network computers.\n\"I believe that our organisational structure should always be flexible and adaptive as we encounter and embrace change in the new IBM,\" Gerstner said in a memo to employees. A copy of the memo was obtained by Reuters.\n\"I would be surprised if Lou Gerstner is happy with the lack of growth coming out of servers,\" said Daniel Ries at Nomura Securities. \"That is one of his strengths, he says, 'this is not a country club' and he does not accept poor performance.\"\nIn the second quarter, IBM's hardware sales were basically flat at $8.5 billion while sales of AS\/400 minicomputers fell as customers waited for new products. Its workstations were hurt by the growing popularity of workstation-like PCs running Windows NT.\nIBM also said Jim Vanderslice, 56, general manager of IBM's storage systems division, will become a vice president and add network hardware and printing systems to his responsibilities. The hard disk drive business was one of the stellar performers in the past two quarters for IBM.\nThe changes will be effective Aug. 1.\nIBM stock fell 75 cents to $103 in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading after rising steadily ahead of Monday's earnings report.\n","classes":[11,15,16,41,42,44],"classes_pad":null}

But without the West Coast, that build became a draw of 1.03 million barrels.\nFueled by what some traders called record implied gasoline demand of 8.88 million barrels per day (bpd), August gasoline was up 18 points at 60.20 cents a gallon.\nAPI said gasoline stocks fell by 2.79 million barrels to 197.8 million despite both high output and imports of 8.02 million bpd and 458,000 bpd respectively.\nOn the distillate side, a drop of 1.25 million barrels that brought stocks to 120.1 million laid waste to forecasts for a build of 2.0 million barrels. But August heating oil was about steady from the earlier close at 52.70 cents a gallon.\n\"I would gather that the (API) report would be supportive for products,\" Hughes said referring to the drops in gasoline and distillate stocks.\nBut some analysts cautioned that the draw in East Coast reformulated gasoline stocks was a disappointing one million barrels a day, and that more broadly speaking, the API implied demand may be inflating interpretations of demand at the pump.\n\"The high implied demand numbers for the past two weeks capture the stock shift from primary to secondary storage and that can't continue for much longer,\" said Richard Redash, senior energy analyst at Prudential Securities in New York.\nRefinery run rates ticked down by a negligible 0.1 percentage point, leaving utilization at the still-high level of 96.7 percent.\n-- New York Oil  Desk +1 212 859 1633\n","classes":[29,44,119,122,123],"classes_pad":null}

Police said he abducted, pistol-whipped, raped and strangled the 44-year-old secretary before dumping her body in a field.\nO'Dell was arrested after leaving bloody clothing at a girlfriend's house. She turned him in after learning the slaying had occurred in an area that O'Dell frequented.\nThe case was one of Virginia's costliest by the time of his 1986 conviction. But it has since become possibly the most contentious capital murder case in the state's history.\nPope John Paul and Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi have led a chorus of protest against his death sentence. On Monday alone, the Vatican's television station made a plea for clemency and Prodi told reporters in Luxemburg he had made \"a last, very strong, heartfelt appeal\" to Allen.\nO'Dell has been made an honorary citizen of the city of Palermo and has said he wants to be buried there if his execution goes forward as planned.\nThe Virginian-Pilot newspaper reported on Tuesday that Italian authorities discussed flying his body to the Sicilian capital on an Italian Air Force plane.\nItalian officials met Allen's counsel Mark Christie on Monday and asked him to permit a new DNA test.\n\"I think nobody can say that he is sure Joseph O'Dell is guilty,\" said Leoluca Orlando, mayor of Palermo and a member of the European Parliament. \"I hope that Governor Allen will stop this execution.\"\nAllen, a Republican known for his vigorous anti-crime stance, has said he believes O'Dell is guilty and refused to allow new DNA testing in the case.\nThe condemned man's supporters questioned the testing. A DNA test done on O'Dell's shirt in 1990 showed that blood on it did not belong to O'Dell or Schartner. But tests on the blood on his jacket showed by odds of 166,000 to one that the blood was Schartner's.\nThe National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty urged Allen to allow DNA testing of a sperm sample.\nThe coalition's director, Steve Hawkins, told a news conference on Tuesday O'Dell's case \"underscores for us many of the problems that we see inherent in the use of the death penalty in the United States.\"\nThe case was one where new scientific advances may be able to prove innocence, he said. \"We feel quite strongly that he is richly deserving of a reprieve from the governor.\"\nO'Dell is represented by Washington and New York law firms as well as a New York public relations agency. His \"spiritual adviser\" is Sister Helen Prejean, author of \"Dead Man Walking,\" the best-selling book that was made into a movie.\nLori Urs, a paralegal who is a close friend of O'Dell and volunteers on his legal team, said she had met with him for an hour on Monday and that he was holding up well.\nPrison officials said on Tuesday they were considering letting O'Dell marry Urs in the hours before his execution.\n\"There was a formal request by both the inmate and Lori Urs received by the warden ... yesterday, requesting that they be able to be married prior to his July 23 execution,\" Botkins said.\nO'Dell's execution had been scheduled for Dec. 18, 1996, but was stayed that day by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n","classes":[90,91],"classes_pad":null}

{"codes":["E21","E211","ECAT"],"headline":"June budget surplus shrinks U.S. deficit this year.","text":"\nThe federal budget deficit shriveled to $10.87 billion for the first nine months of the fiscal year as a vibrant economy generated a record surplus for June, the Treasury Department said Tuesday.\nThe monthly report, which was issued as Congress and the White House haggled over details of their agreement to balance the budget in five years, bolstered the notion that the surprising vitality of the U.S. economy could raise enough revenue to wipe out the deficit by the end of next year.\nIn June, government revenues from taxes, fees and other sources exceeded expenses by $54.52 billion, topping the previous record surplus for that month of $34.34 billion in 1996, the Treasury said. In May, the government had a $48.49 billion deficit.\nThe surplus exceeded private economists' expectations, but was in line with a prediction of the Congressional Budget Office. The record budget surplus for any month was $93.94 billion in April, a month in which revenues are always high because of the tax filing deadline.\nWith the government awash in unexpected cash, the deficit through the first nine months of fiscal year 1997, which ends on Sept. 30, fell 85 percent to $10.87 billion from $74.02 billion at the same point in 1996.\nMany economists expect fiscal 1997 to wind up with a modest budget deficit of about $50 billion, after a $106.99 billion in 1996. They expect it to fade completely by the end of next year if current policy is left unchanged by Congress and the White House.\nSen. Bob Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat who is on the Senate Finance Committee, predicted after the report that the 1997 deficit would be in the $30 billion range.\n\"I would say no later than two quarters beyond the close of our fiscal year the deficit's going to be gone,\" he said. \"We'll be in surplus, the economy growing like it is, leaving open the question, what exactly is it that we're doing here?\"\nIronically, a budget deal, which includes tax and spending cuts that are still being hashed out, could widen the deficit next year, even though it would wipe out the budget shortfall by the year 2002.\nWhite House Budget Director Franklin Raines has called the idea of letting the budget balance itself without a five-year agreement \"absurd\" and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said Tuesday that any naturally occurring balanced budget would not last long.\nBoth officials said an agreement was needed on taxes and spending to ensure that a balanced budget can be sustained.

They thought OSHA was taking care of that,\" he said, referring to the federal Occupation Safety and Health Administration.\n\"But OSHA thought that FAA took care of everything that was in the air and so they weren't caring about that. This was a group of people who had fallen through a crack,\" he said.\nStedman, a chemist at the University of Denver, said his panel investigated secondhand smoke aboard U.S. airliners in 1984-85 and issued a report recommending a ban on in-flight smoking in 1986. Such a ban was ordered two years later.\n\"We know that the people most at risk were flight attendants,\" Stedman said during questioning by an attorney representing about 60,000 non-smoking flight attendants suing the cigarette makers.\nStedman said flight attendants were especially vulnerable to secondhand smoke since they exerted themselves waiting on passengers and the galleys where they spent much time working were often in the rear smoking sections of airliners.\n\"We saw no evidence that running up and down in (such an) environment was good for them,\" Stedman said during questioning by Walter Cofer, a lawyer for defendants Philip Morris and Lorrillard.\nAnother witness, Katharine Hammond, author of a 1989 study on crews working in smoky cabins, said a flight attendant on a long flight would take in more cancer-causing agents than passengers because they breathed deeply as they carried trays and moved through the cabins.\n\"The more you breathe, the more the exposure,\" said Hammond, a professor at the School of Health at the University of California at Berkeley.\nShe estimated that the cancer-causing agents that a flight attendant inhaled on a long flight would be roughly equivalent to smoking five to 10 cigarettes.\nHammond also said scientists and physicians generally agreed that secondhand smoke caused lung cancer and was a prime suspect as a cause of heart diseases.\nIn their lawsuit, the nonsmoking flight attendants say their respiratory, heart and other illnesses were caused by passenger cigarette smoke.\nTobacco company lawyers say flight attendants' exposure to secondhand smoke was trivial and their illnesses may have been caused by ozone, cosmic radiation or other health risks.\n\"We certainly believed that ETS (environmental tobacco smoke) was the major health risk faced by passengers or cabin crew in airlines,\" Stedman said.\nUnder questioning by Cofer, Stedman said he knew nothing of a U.S. Department of Transportation written response to his panel's report that the department had been responsible for monitoring air quality in passenger jets.\nTestimony in the case, the first class action against the tobacco industry to go to trial and the first involving secondhand smoke claims, was scheduled to continue through September.\nPlaintiffs' attorney Stanley Rosenblatt has said he would seek at least $5 billion in damages in the case.\n","classes":[12,13,44,90,91,99],"classes_pad":null}
{"codes":["E11","E12","ECAT"],"headline":"Greenspan says U.S. growth slowing, for now.","text":"\nBy Rich Miller, Economics Correspondent\nFederal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said on Tuesday the central bank would raise interest rates if needed to head off inflation, but suggested that might not happen anytime soon.\n\"I have no doubt that the current stance of policy ... will need to be changed at some point,\" Greenspan said in prepared testimony to a House Banking subcommittee.\n\"For the present, as I indicated, demand growth does appear to have moderated, but whether that moderation will be sufficient to avoid putting additional pressures on resources is an open question,\" he said.\nWall Street stock and bond prices bounded higher as investors took heart from Greenspan's suggestion that Fed policy was on hold.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average soared 154.93 points to close at a record 8,061.65 on Tuesday, while the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1-22\/32. The long bond's yield sank to 6.41 percent -- its lowest level in more than seven months -- from 6.54 percent at Monday's close.\nGreenspan spent much of his testimony discussing the reasons behind the recent stellar performance of the U.S. economy and whether that can be maintained.\nUnlike in his last Humphrey Hawkins testimony in February and in an earlier speech in December, Greenspan shied away from cautioning investors in the stock market that they might be \"irrationally exuberant\" on the outlook for the economy and corporate profits.\nInstead, he suggested the economy might be undergoing some \"basic improvements\" thanks to technological advances that were boosting worker productivity and corporate profits.\nBut he made clear that the Fed was watching the economy closely for any signs that the recent good news on inflation was coming to an end. Wholesale prices have fallen for a record six straight months, while consumer prices have risen so far this year at their slowest pace since 1986.\n\"With considerable momentum behind the expansion and labour market utilization rates unusually high, the Federal Reserve must be alert to the possibility that additional action might be called for to forestall excessive credit creation,\" Greenspan said.\nHe described the job market as tight, with employers having an increasingly tough time finding workers suited to their needs. At 5.0 percent the unemployment rate is hovering near its lowest levels in a quarter century.\nGreenspan said wage demands have been held down by a lingering fear among workers that they will lose their jobs, although those concerns have dissipated somewhat.\n\"If the pace of job creation continues, the pressures on wages and other costs of hiring increasing numbers of such individuals could escalate more rapidly,\" he said.\nThe Fed last raised a key interest rate by a quarter percentage point in March to head off the threat of inflation. But since then, U.S. economic growth has moderated and inflation has remained subdued despite the tight labour market.\nGreenspan said Fed policy-makers are \"reasonably confident\" that inflation will be quite modest this year. But, he added, they see faster inflation next year as recent declines in food, energy and import prices come to an end.\nFed policy-makers generally see consumer prices rising by 2.25 percent to 2.50 percent this year and 2.5 percent to 3 percent next year.\nGreenspan said that economic growth \"fortunately\" seems to have slowed from its rapid pace during the winter, but he cautioned that that might have partly been due to temporary factors.\n\"Business and consumer confidence remains high and financial conditions are supportive of growth,\" he said. \"Particularly notable is the runup in stock market wealth.\"\nThe steep rise in the stock market has not yet fuelled a surge in demand for consumer goods but it might yet, he added.\nThe U.S. economy rose at a 5.9 percent annualized clip in the first quarter, its fastest rate in more than nine years and well above the pace that economists reckon is sustainable on a long-term basis without engendering inflation.\nFed policy-makers see economic growth slowing to 2 percent to 2.5 percent next year from 3 percent to 3.25 percent this year.\n\"The Federal Reserve is intent on gearing its policy to facilitate the maximum sustainable growth of the economy,\" Greenspan said. \"But it is not ... involved in an experiment that deliberately prods the economy to see how far and fast it can grow.\n\"The cost of a failed experiment would be much too burdensome for too many of our citizens.\"\n","classes":[45,46,70],"classes_pad":null}

To survive in the long term, TWA must bolster its cash reserves, attract more high-paying business customers, and stem the bleeding of profits, analysts said.\nTWA, which has lost money ever since the Paris-bound Boeing 747 exploded off the coast of Long Island, N.Y., last year, is expected to announce another loss when it reports its second-quarter financial results Wednesday.\nWall Street expects TWA to post a second-quarter loss of 23 cents a share, compared with a profit of 45 cents a share a year earlier, according to First Call, which tracks analysts' expectations.\nA TWA spokesman said the airline was not aware of any one-time charges or severance costs related to the layoffs.\nThe job cuts are an inevitable part of upgrading the fleet, as newer planes require less maintenance work and fewer workers, analysts said.\nTWA plans to take delivery of about 52 new and recent-vintage used aircraft worth more than $2 billion over the next two years.\nThe St. Louis-based carrier said the average age of its fleet will shrink to 16.7 years by the end of the year, down from the current average of about 17.8 years, but higher than the industry average of 11.9 years.\nTWA, the seventh largest U.S. airline, declined to comment on whether additional staff changes would be made after December.\n\"This (job cut announcement) brings us through December. Beyond that, I don't know,\" said TWA spokesman Mark Abels. \"We're always looking at increasing the productivity of our work force.\"\nThe layoffs include 250 posts at its overhaul base in Kansas City, Mo., and 625 in maintenance, airport operations and reservations.\nOne industry analyst said although some job cuts were expected, the layoffs in the reservations unit were inconsistent with TWA's statement that it was slashing jobs because of reduced maintenance needs.\nTwenty-three of TWA's domestic line maintenance stations will be consolidated into 13 locations, reducing staff by 200, airport operations staff will be cut by about 200 and reservations sales staff by 225 positions, for a total of 625 in those three areas.\nMost maintenance job cuts will be made through furloughs, although some will be made through attrition, while most of the airport operations and all of the reservations sales staff cuts will be made through attrition, TWA said.\nManagement, non-contract and contract employees will be affected, the airline said.\nLine maintenance stations under review for closure include those at Boston; Washington National; Washington Dulles; Philadelphia; Miami; Cleveland; Atlanta; Columbus, Ohio; Cincinnati; and Detroit. The list of line maintenance station closings will be reviewed with representatives of TWA's machinists union, the company said.\nThe machinists union could not be reached for comment.\n","classes":[43,44,62,70,90,100],"classes_pad":null}

The UAE is reserving the right to purchase a good package; it may not exclusively be limited to U.S. fighters.\"\nNegotiations on the 80-fighter package, fiercely contested by European arms makers, have been under way for years.\nThe Washington Times newspaper reported on Monday that the UAE told the Pentagon \"unofficially\" last Friday that it planned to buy U.S. F-16s, made by Lockheed-Martin Corp., rather than European jet fighters.\nUAE sources familiar with the deal told Reuters earlier this month finance packages offered by three of the West's top warplane makers would decide the winner in the competition mainly between Washington, London and Paris.\nThe F-16 is in a race against France's Dassault Aviation Rafale and the Eurofighter 2000, made by a consortium of British Aerospace, Germany's Daimler-Benz Aerospace (DASA), Spain's Construcciones Aeronauticas SA (CASA) and Italy's Alenia Spa.\nThe warplane deal could be worth $6 billion, a senior UAE military source said.\nPrice is not the only issue being considered, the expert told Reuters in a telephone interview. \"This should be taken in the context of UAE military needs first and foremost, and second is UAE bilateral relations and defence agreements.\"\nOne sticking point is the UAE's dissatisfaction with the current U.S. policy that puts American military personnel under U.S. legal jurisdiction when they visit ports including those in UAE, the expert said.\nUAE wants the hundreds of thousands of visiting Americans under the jurisdiction of its own Islamic court system.\n\"What UAE is asking is really something natural, something any sovereign nation is looking for, the expert said. \"In the final analysis this will protect U.S. personnel\" by acting as a deterrent to crime, the expert said.\nNo timetable has been set for a decision on the purchase, which could take \"a matter of months\" to conclude, the expert said.\nThe expert said there could be \"clarification\" on this issue following the meeting with Cohen, and indicated the UAE chief of staff would also talk with others in the U.S. government about bilateral relations.\nCohen visited the oil-rich Gulf region last month, stopping in UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman.\n","classes":[38,39,44,90,92],"classes_pad":null}

But Caterpillar stock fell 37.5 cents to $56.375 in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading, as investors took profits after the stock had rallied strongly for much of the year.\nCaterpillar's statement saying sales and profits would be \"moderately higher\" in the second half was \"very extensive, very upbeat and for a second-quarter release very unusual for these guys to do,\" said J. Blair Brumley, analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc.\nThe company reported sales of $8.5 billion and profits of $691 million for the second half of 1996.\nEconomies around the world are improving, mainly due to the surprising strength of the U.S. economy, and Caterpillar gets nearly half its sales outside the United States. U.S. sales grew 20 percent to $2.42 billion while sales outside the United States rose 14 percent $2.26 billion in the quarter.\nThe company said it expects demand for machines and engines to rise this year and remain at strong levels next year despite slower economic growth in the United States.\nCaterpillar said tight fiscal policies in Europe may cause a slight decline in demand for construction equipment for the rest of 1997, while in Japan tax increases and lower public works spending should slow demand for the rest of the year.\nDemand in Europe and Japan should improve next year, though uncertainties over public spending and other aspects of government policy remain for both regions, it said.\n\"Europe is very important to us, and we're starting to see, I think, some stirrings of a little stronger economy,\" Chief Financial Officer Douglas Oberhelman said in an interview.\nRegarding the drop in Caterpillar's stock, he said, \"I think it's the old adage of buy the rumour, sell the news.\"\nOperating profit margins rose to 26.2 percent of sales in the latest quarter from 25.7 percent a year earlier.\nHigher unit sales and cost increases over the past year were partly offset by an unfavourable change in product sales mix and increased fixed manufacturing costs, the company said.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses rose 18 percent to $483 million as Caterpillar boosted spending on growth and product line expansion.\n\"I think Caterpillar realises that many marketplaces are mature,\" said Thomas Burns Jr. at Natwest Securities Corp. \"You need more product lines.\"\n","classes":[15,16,44],"classes_pad":null}

Revenues rose 2 percent to $5.2 billion.\nThe quarterly results were slightly above Wall Street's consensus estimate of 67 cents a share, sending Disney's stock sharply higher. It gained $2.4375 to $77.625 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.\nAnalysts said Disney's results were aided by lower expenses and tax rates during the quarter, but even without the modest gains, Disney's three main businesses -- theme parks, broadcasting and film studios -- turned in a solid performance.\n\"The results for the quarter and year to date demonstrate the continued operating strength of the company,\" Chairman Michael Eisner said in a statement. \"I am particularly pleased with the performance of our creative content segment, which is benefiting from improved live-action films and the successful release of 'Hercules.' a   \"Our theme parks continue to enjoy a year of record attendance driven by the popularity of the 25th Anniversary celebration at Walt Disney World,\" Eisner added. \"Our cable operations, especially ESPN and The Disney Channel, also continue to be strong contributors to the company's results as we proceed with our worldwide expansion of those businesses.\"\nDisney's broadcasting unit, which has attracted considerable attention because of a ratings drop at ABC TV and the ongoing controversy involving embattled ABC Entertainment President Jamie Tarses, posted better-than-expected results. Cable networks ESPN and The Disney Channel continued to enjoy double-digit increases in subscribers.\nMerrill Lynch analyst Jessica Reif said ESPN's operating income was up about 30 percent during the quarter, while operating income at the Disney Channel rose about 20 percent.\nOverall, broadcasting unit revenues for the quarter increased 5 percent to $1.6 billion, and operating income rose 7 percent to $337 million. Disney said broadcasting results were hurt by ratings declines at No. 3 network ABC.\nABC is dramatically revamping its fall lineup to compete with No. 1 network NBC and attract more affluent viewers. At the same time, Disney is trying to minimise the drama unfolding in its executive offices. In June, Disney named veteran television executive Stuart Bloomberg to the post of chairman of the entertainment division, prompting many critics to speculate that Tarses, who was hired last year, may be on her way out. So far, ABC and Tarses continue to deny she will leave.\nBut an unfavourable \"New York Times Magazine\" profile of the former NBC executive has kept the controversy going. On Wednesday, Tarses' future may become a little clearer after she addresses a group of television writers in Pasadena, Calif., during the network's fall preview. ABC officials say Tarses is not planning any blockbuster announcements on Wednesday and is likely to remain at the network for the time being.\nOperating income from Disney's creative content division, which includes filmmaking, video and retail outlets, rose 17 percent in the third quarter to $333 million, as films such as \"Con Air\", \"Scream\" and \"The English Patient\" easily outpaced the weaker year-ago offerings of \"Celtic Pride\", \"Last Dance\" and \"Eddie\". However, revenues were down 4 percent, reflecting fewer live-action films released during the quarter.\nDisney's theme parks posted record results, with revenues up 10 percent to $1.4 billion, and operating income adding 11 percent to $390 million. However, analysts said attendance growth slowed to about 3 percent to 5 percent in the third quarter from about 7 percent to 9 percent in the second quarter.\nAnalysts said attendance at Walt Disney World in Florida was up about 5 percent while Disneyland was flat to slightly lower than the year-ago period.\nFor the rest of the year, Disney's theme park business is expected to face difficult comparisons with last year's strong performance, but attendance should pick up considerably next year when Disney opens its newest park, called Animal Kingdom, next spring.\nThe company bought ABC in February 1996 and completed the purchase during the second quarter of this year. Disney posted a $225 million charge last year from the acquisition.\nThe company also recorded a $300 million charge a year ago from an accounting change, and a $135 million gain from the sale of station KCAL-TV in the first quarter of the current year. Excluding the non-recurring items, revenues for the nine-month period increased 6 percent to $17.0 billion and net income increased 27 percent to $1.5 billion, or $2.15 a share.\n","classes":[15,16,44],"classes_pad":null}

{"codes":["GCAT","GPOL"],"headline":"Gingrich tries to get Republicans back to business.","text":"\nHouse Speaker Newt Gingrich tried on Tuesday to quell turmoil within the Republican Party amid speculation that his third-in-command will resign.\nA spokesman for Republican Whip Tom DeLay of Texas denied that the Texas lawmaker will step down from his leadership position. \"He is not resigning,\" John Feehery said.\nGingrich spokeswoman Christina Martin said the Georgia Republican had urged members not to seek a vote on the leadership at Wednesday's meeting of all 238 Republican lawmakers. \"It is his preference today not to hold a special conference and that we not challenge the leadership in the next conference,\" she told reporters.\nSeveral Republican dissidents had pointed to DeLay, the third-ranking Republican in the House, as an active participant in meetings two weeks ago to replace Gingrich with a leader who would take a harder line with the White House on budget and tax negotiations.\nIn an indication of deepening party intrigue, Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas issued an emotional apology to his colleagues for mistakenly believing that only a small group of dissidents, none of whom were in the House leadership, was responsible for an attempt to oust the speaker.\n\"I apologise for my initial belief that the dissidents were solely responsible for starting this mess,\" Gingrich deputy Armey said.\nIn the two-page letter, Armey affirmed his loyalty to Gingrich and denied publicly for a third time that he had participated in the aborted coup. He said Gingrich was well aware that he did not try to \"dump\" him.\n\"Never have I said that I was in favour of any plan to remove the speaker, and no member can truthfully say they ever heard me say that, because I didn't.\"\n\"At this point, I couldn't care less whether I'll be speaker, majority leader, or dogcatcher, but I'll be damned if I'll let my name and honour be destroyed,\" he said.\nThe House leadership team delayed until Tuesday evening its regular business meeting to discuss the status of tax and budget negotiations and a progress report on the annual spending bills moving through the House, Martin said.\n\"The speaker would prefer the leadership stay focused as a united team and not allow one week's events to stand in the way of success\" she said.\nBut that might prove difficult.\nA group of second-term Republicans, some of whom were involved in efforts to replace the speaker, were to meet privately Tuesday night. The leadership is elected by Republican lawmakers and not appointed by the speaker, nor can it be disbanded by the speaker alone.\nThis sophomore class includes many of the most conservative members who were swept into the House in the same political wave that brought the party back into control of that chamber for the first time in 40 years. Among them are several who met to discuss ousting Gingrich July 10. Many of them are also allied closely with DeLay's more conservative, confrontational political style.\nThis conservative group has urged Gingrich to take a harder line with the White House on taxes and spending as he did during the heyday of the so-called \"Republican revolution\" of 1995.\nRepublicans will have to deal with the coup attempt eventually, party sources said.\nOn Wednesday all House Republicans will gather for the first time since the dissent within the ranks became public, but Gingrich would prefer they focus on pending legislation, Martin said.\nIn his letter, Armey acknowledged he had made mistakes in the past two weeks. He said he attended one meeting in which \"what if\" scenarios were discussed based on reports of an uprising against Gingrich. He also said he was mistaken to assume no member of the leadership was involved.\n","classes":[90,104],"classes_pad":null}

We just can't have that.\"\n\"It may be a movement in the right direction,\" said Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee. But he added a note of scepticism, saying, \"The only collection arm I know at Treasury is IRS.\"\nSen. Pete Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said he would look at the idea but added, \"If it has something in there that really has IRS in it but you're covering it up, it may never sell.\"\nAs described by White House spokesman Mike McCurry, under Clinton's proposal the Treasury would send citizens a form to determine whether they should pay the higher premium. If so, they would write a check to the Medicare Trust Fund which would be due the same day as their income taxes, April 15.\nAlthough McCurry initially said the check for the Treasury could be included with regular income tax returns, other White House officials said the details were not set.\nMcCurry acknowledged the arrangement seemed something of a fig leaf, quoting one senior White House official as saying, \"It is a cosmetic solution to a cosmetic problem.\"\nClinton said he offered the change to salvage the proposal, which has been strongly opposed by House members who fear the move would create a political backlash against them.\nHistorically, the influential American Association of Retired Persons and other seniors groups have opposed any effort to raise Medicare premiums. In the 1980s, the lobby for the elderly forced Congress to reverse a similar plan.\nClinton, however, appeared to suggest the politics of the issue have changed and most U.S. citizens would back a rise.\n\"My best judgment is that a big majority of the American people will support this,\" he said, adding, \"I would be happy to defend the vote of any member of Congress -- Democrat or Repulican -- who votes for this.\"\nFlorida Republican Sen. Connie Mack, whose state includes a large number of retirees, appeared to disagree, \"He's given us permission to shoot ourselves in the foot on Medicare.\"\n","classes":[55,56,70,90,99,104],"classes_pad":null}

Inc.'s profits rising 13 percent and RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. pulling out of the red after a restructuring.\nSpeculation swirled that the White House is prepared to sign off on a multibillion-dollar industry settlement, combining with the strong profits to boost the companies' stocks.\nThe results were about in line with expectations on Wall Street, but Philip Morris stock rose $2.125 to $42.625 in consolidated trading. It was the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange, with volume of 8.1 million shares. RJR Nabisco rose $1.0625 to $30.875 in consolidated NSYE trading.\n\"The main reason the stock rallied today was as a result that the White House might approve the settlement deal,\" Smith Barney analyst Martin Feldman said.\n\"It's nice to see stocks respond to earnings,\" added Salomon Brothers analyst Diana Temple.\nUnder the settlement, the industry would cut back on marketing and advertising practices and pay out $368 billion over 25 years, some of it for financing public health and anti-smoking programmes.\nWhite House spokesman Mike McCurry said Tuesday that U.S. President Bill Clinton is not expected to make a final decision on the settlement before next month.\nHowever, analysts said there was increasing speculation that the administration's task force reviewing the accord is likely to recommend that Clinton accept it.\nAnalysts said both companies showed they were in a position to continue posting strong growth in their earnings for at least the rest of the year.\nDespite being dealt setbacks in the media and in the courtroom in the past year, tobacco companies can weather the storm, analysts said.\n\"There is a complete disconnect from what the media says about these companies and their financial performance,\" Dean Witter Reynolds analyst David Adelman said. \"It doesn't affect what the consumer wants.\"\nPhilip Morris said net income for the quarter ended June 30 rose to $1.84 billion, or 76 cents a share, from $1.62 billion, or 66 cents a share.\nThe company, which makes Marlboro cigarettes, Miller beer and Kraft foods as well as other brands, said revenues climbed 5 percent to $18.4 billion from $17.5 billion.\nIts tobacco revenues grew 11 percent to $10.2 billion from $9.2 billion while food sales declined 1.2 percent to $6.9 billion from $7 billion, mainly due to the adverse impact of currency fluctuations.\nPhilip Morris said earnings from tobacco jumed 13 percent to $2.3 billion, from $2 billion, while earnings from food rose 8 percent to $1.1 billion, from $1.0 billion.\nThe New York-based company said shipments of Marlboro cigarettes rose almost 10 percent to 42.6 billion units, giving the brand a 34.6 percent share of industry sales, a gain of 3.2 points.\nIts other premium brands, including Merit, Benson & Hedges, Parliament and Virginia Slims, accounted for 7.8 percent of industry shipments, down 0.3 point.\nRJR Nabisco, whose business is about evenly split between tobacco and food products, mainly snacks, said it posted net income of $243 million, or 71 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $27 million, or 10 cents a share.\nThe 1996 results included a $428 million charge for restructuring the company's sales force.\nThe company -- which abandoned its controversial \"Joe Camel\" advertising character this month -- said total revenues edged up 2 percent to $4.29 billion, from $4.20 billion.\nTobacco sales, fuelled by the Camel brand, rose 3 percent to $2.1 billion, from $2 billion, with domestic sales rising to $1.22 billion from $1.17 billion.\nFood sales grew to $2.19 billion from $2.18 billion, driven by strong growth in sales of its Oreo and other cookie brands.

{"codes":["C15","C152","CCAT"],"headline":"Fund investors shouldn't overlook income.","text":"\nThese days, it's hard to find a financial adviser who will talk much about bonds and other income investments. They'd rather celebrate the stock market's big gains. But income investments deserve at least a small place in every investor's portfolio.\nBy now, most investors have heard they should invest their long-term savings in stocks. After all, stocks have delivered the greatest long-term returns and offer the best chance at staying ahead of inflation during the coming decades.\nMeanwhile, however, stocks are likely to be quite volatile. And while investors have been willing to ride out recent setbacks in stocks, they might act differently if a severe bear market takes prices 20 percent, 30 percent or even 40 percent lower. And what if stocks don't rebound right away as they have after recent corrections?\nSome investors might find it hard to ride out even short-term stock market setbacks. For example, a middle-aged father with kids in college might need to tap his savings to meet current bills. Similarly, a retired investor who wants to keep a cushion for medical bills would be uncomfortable investing too much in stocks.\nThe solution is to invest at least some of your money in funds that can produce current income and protect your principal. Such funds invest in a wide range of securities, including high-yield stocks and a variety of bonds and other fixed-income securities. Such investments tend to hold up better than growth-oriented holdings during periods when stock prices are falling. Moreover, they provide current income that can bolster your portfolio's performance when capital gains are scarce.\nHow much should you invest in income funds? Some financial advisors recommend that the portion of your long-term savings invested in income-oriented assets should equal your age expressed as a percentage: That is, if you are 30, invest 30 percent in income-oriented funds; at age 70 the percentage can climb to 70 percent.\nMany planners recommend a more aggressive approach if you are in sound financial shape and don't mind some bumps and bruises in the pursuit of higher gains.\nBut whatever balance you choose between income and growth, you should try to select funds that will efficiently implement your strategy. Here are some funds that can add a dose of income to your investment portfolio.\nInvestment-grade bond funds: These funds hold high-quality government and corporate bonds with little credit risk. Their share prices do fluctuate with interest rates, but you can minimise that risk by sticking with funds that hold short-term and intermediate bonds.\nOne good candidate is Stein Roe Intermediate Bond (800-338-2550; $2,500 minimum investment; no load). The fund's average maturity is 8.4 years. Fund manager Michael T. Kennedy invests in a variety of investment-grade corporate and government bonds.\nIf you're willing to take some more interest rate risk, check out Vanguard Bond Index-Total Bond Market (800-662-7447; $3,000 minimum; no load). It tries to track the performance of the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index.\nInternational funds: Investing in foreign bond markets may sound like an odd way to add stability to your portfolio. But buying overseas bonds can reduce the risk of your income holdings, because they will be less dependent on the day-to-day fluctuations of the U.S. bond market. That said, make sure the fund you choose is broadly diversified and has a good track record.\nCompass Capital International Bond Fund (888-426-6727; $5,000 minimum; no load) recently invested 58.5 percent of its assets in Europe, with the rest distributed primarily among Japan, Canada and the United States. The fund has generated annual gains of 9.4 percent during the past five years vs. 5.9 percent for the typical international bond fund, with 38 percent less volatility.\nMultisector funds: Your best choice may be a fund that invests in different sectors of the bond market. Such funds sometimes shift their assets among a wide range of income investments, including high-quality and low-quality issues in the United States as well as developed and emerging overseas markets.\nMultisector funds that make extremely large bets on a single type of security when they think it offers good value can be dangerous. But some entries in this category have generated superior returns with average risk by investing in a broadly diversified mix of income investments.\nDreyfus Strategic Income (800-645-6561; $2,500 minimum; no load) is a good example. It's gained 8.6 percent annually during the past five years vs. 7.8 percent for the typical multisector fund. Manager Kevin McClintock invests in a variety of bond sectors, including U.S government and corporate issues as well as some foreign debt.\n(EDITORS: Clint Willis is a free-lance writer who covers mutual funds for Reuters.

{"codes":["GCAT","GDIP","GREL"],"headline":"U.S. report says China squashes religious freedom.","text":"\nThe U.S. State Department accused China on Tuesday of violating constitutional pledges of religious freedom by clamping all religious activity under government control.\nA report on religious freedom around the world also condemned as restrictive new legislation pending in Russia that would favour major faiths at the expense of religious groups with small followings.\nThe 86-page report, \"United States policies in support of religious freedom\", was written at the request of Congress and focused on the situation of Christians, looking specifically at treatment of believers in 78 countries.\nIn an introduction, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said religious liberty was \"central to American history and identity\" and its promotion was \"a fundamental source of our strength in the world... We simply could not lead without it.\"\nShe said the State Department had raised religious freedom up its agenda, asking U.S. embassies to provide more reporting, stressing the issue more in its annual human rights report and taking more stock of religious persecution in asylum requests.\nCongress obliged the State Department to compile the report by writing it into in a foreign relations funding bill for the current fiscal year.\nIn an apparent attempt to head off criticism of the report's focus on Christians, John Shattuck, assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labour, said this was specified by Congress.\n\"I want to stress... that administration policy and our actions around the world support religious freedom globally and apply to all religions and beliefs,\" Shattuck told a news conference.\n\"We do not see this topic (treatment of Christians) as more important than other topics involving religious freedom.\"\nIn its section on China, the report quoted the Chinese constitution as stating that citizens \"enjoy freedom of religious belief\".\n\"Nonetheless, the Government of China has sought to restrict all actual religious practice to government-authorised religious organisations and registered places of worship,\" the State Department said.\nIt said that following a central policy directive, Chinese authorities in some areas sought to crack down on unregistered Catholic and Protestant movements in 1996 and 1997.\nThe report said the United States had made freedom of religion a major focus of its human rights policy towards China and President Bill Clinton and other leaders had raised the issue frequently in talks with Chinese officials.\nThe assurance failed to satisfy some Congressional critics. Republican Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri told the Senate on Tuesday that despite the report, Clinton had \"not made a sound\" on the persecution of Christians in China.\nDiscussing Russia, the report said the new legislation, passed by parliament but not yet signed into law by President Boris Yeltsin, would restrict the activities of foreign missionaries and new or minority confessions or sects.\nClinton had expressed concern to Yeltsin last month over the law and other administration officials had raised it with Russian counterparts, it said.\nThe report stated bluntly that in Saudi Arabia, where Islam is the official religion, \"freedom of religion does not exist\".\nIn Sudan, which is on the U.S. list of countries sponsoring terrorism, the report dismissed government claims that all religions were respected, saying there was forced conversion to Islam of Christians, animists and other non-Moslems.\nThe report echoed criticisms of Germany in the State Department's annual human rights report for its treatment of Scientologists, who it said had reported \"discrimination and harassment\" there.\n","classes":[90,93,106],"classes_pad":null}

{"codes":["C22","CCAT"],"headline":"We, magazine for people with disabilities.","text":"\nFifty million Americans have disabilities -- impairments of sensory, motor or mental functions. Regardless, many people with disabilities enjoy fashions, dining in fine restaurants and travel.\nA group of New York-based entrepreneurs felt there were no media outlets that addressed the lives of people with disabilities, especially ones that put an emphasis on \"people\" first.\nThere are many niche magazines that deal with specific disabilities or conditions, but \"they were limited in scope. ... They weren't consumer oriented and didn't have a style that would appeal to Madison Avenue,\" said Raymond Coppola, vice president and co-publisher of We, a new magazine for people with disabilities, their families and friends.\n\"There was no lifesytyle consumer magazine talking to 50 million Americans with disabilitiies,\" he said.\nWe, published every two months, made its debut in March. Its publishers hope it will fill this broad gap.\nCoppola's idea for a magazine addressed a twofold reality, he said. One reality was that of pure business. He wanted to find a need and fill it.\nThe second evolved from his friendship with college buddy Terry Moakley, now We's editorial director. The two men had parallel lives in many ways. Both men like to travel, dine out and have money to spend. But Moakley broke his neck after college in a diving accident and now uses a wheelchair.\nMoakley was the kind of reader Coppola wanted to design a magazine for. He wanted general interst articles like those in an Esquire or Cosmopolitan, but wanted specific information, such as wheelchair access, in articles about dining, travel or interior design.\nInitial ideas were floated last September, and the first edition was published in March.\n\"I work fast,\" Coppola said.\nHe also said that because the market of people with disabilities is so ripe for a magazine of this kind, \"it's important to be first.\"\nCurrently, Coppola said, the 50 million Americans with disabilities represent $175 billion in discretionary income. They buy cars, go on vacations and decorate their homes. Articles, as well as advertising, will address that, he said.\nWe, in its first two issues, subtly incorporates people with disabilities into every aspect of the magazine's editoral and advertising content.\nIn a fashion shoot set on a boat, the male model is in a wheelchair and the female has a prosthetic leg. One sees the fashions first, however, and this is what the editors intend, Coppola said.\nIn the August edition, which has Elizabeth Taylor on the cover, one article is \"Heroes of the Upbeat,\" about pop music artists with disabilities. In \"Design by Default,\" an article on interior design, the author writes, \"... designers have failed to realise that when a disability meets a barrier, it creates a handicap. ... It can be as invisible as an attitude, or as solid as a product or building.\"\nEven with seed money from Coppola and Cary Fields, president and co-publisher, the magazine has to be slick enough to appeal to Madison Avenue-type advertisers, Coppola said. The magazine's first two issues do have big-name advertisers, including Avon, Citibank, General Motors and Kraft Foods.\nThere are a large number of advertisements for wheelchairs and other medical devices, but also Hertz rental cars, which advertises its cars equipped with hand controls, and the National Fluid Milk Processor Promotion board, whose milk moustache wearer is Zoe Koplowitz, an athlete with multiple sclerosis.\nIn the future, We is planning a special segment in Fortune magazine's March 12, 1998, issue, dealing with the money behind the largest untapped market in America.\nUpcoming We articles will include one on Stephen Hawking, the mathemetician and cosmologist who has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and a look at the top 10 universities in the country that are accessible to people with disabilities.\nWe, published by We Enterprises, is based in New York City. Coppola said the company hopes to add Web sites, television, video and CD-ROM projects sometime next year.\nThe August edition of We is available at Barnes & Noble bookstores and has a cover price of $3.95.

{"codes":["GCAT","GCRIM"],"headline":"U.S. man to be executed despite papal plea.","text":"\nVirginia authorities say they intend to go ahead with the execution on Wednesday of convicted murderer Joseph Roger O'Dell despite appeals from Pope John Paul and Italian authorities for clemency.\nAlthough a clemency petition is before Governor George Allen, prison officials were moving ahead with preparations for the execution, said David Botkins, a spokesman for the Virginia Department of Corrections.\nO'Dell is due to die by lethal injection on Wednesday at 9 p.m. EDT (0100 GMT Thursday) for the 1985 rape and murder of Helen Schartner of Virginia Beach, Virginia. Police said he abducted, pistol-whipped, raped and strangled the 44-year-old secretary before dumping her body in a field.\nO'Dell was arrested after leaving bloody clothing at a girlfriend's house. She turned him in after learning the slaying had occurred in an area that O'Dell frequented.\nThe case was one of the costliest in Virginia history by the time of his 1986 conviction. But it has since become possibly the most contentious capital murder case in the state's history.\nAnd, although he has no ties to Italy, O'Dell has become a cause celebre there.\nPope John Paul and Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi have led a chorus of protest against his death sentence. On Monday alone, the Vatican's television station made a plea for clemency and Prodi told reporters in Luxemburg he had made \"a last, very strong, heartfelt appeal\" to Allen.\nItalian officials met Allen's counsel Mark Christie on Monday and asked him to permit a new DNA test.\n\"I think nobody can say that he is sure Joseph O'Dell is guilty,\" said Leoluca Orlando, mayor of Palermo and a member of the European Parliament. \"I hope that Governor Allen will stop this execution.\nAllen, a Republican known for his vigorous anti-crime stance, said he believes O'Dell is guilty and refused to allow new DNA testing in the case.\nThe condemned man's supporters questioned the testing. A DNA test done on O'Dell's shirt in 1990 showed that blood on it did not belong to O'Dell or Schartner. But tests on the blood on his jacket showed by odds of 166,000 to one that the blood was Schartner's.\nThe National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty urged Allen to allow DNA testing of a sperm sample.\nThe coalition's director, Steve Hawkins, told a news conference on Tuesday O'Dell's case \"underscores for us many of the problems that we see inherent in the use of the death penalty in the United States.\"\nThe case was one where new scientific advances may be able to prove innocence, he said. \"We feel quiet strongly that he is richly deserving of a reprieve from the governor.\"\nO'Dell is represented by Washington and New York law firms as well as a New York public relations agency.

He has denied any wrongdoing.\nLast month, Tyson Foods said it expected to be indicted in what it described as a \"misguided\" investigation. The company vowed to vigorously contest any charges that might eventually be filed.\nAmong the allegations being investigated are Espy's attendance at a party hosted by retired Tyson Foods chairman Don Tyson in May 1993. Espy and the other 120 guests were allegedly given food and lodging.\nSeveral months later, Espy accepted tickets to watch a Dallas Cowboys football game from the Tyson Foods corporate skybox.\nSo far in the Espy probe, the independent counsel has won convictions against three corporations, five individuals and one law firm, and won $3.5 million in fines.\nBut a lobbyist for Tyson Foods, Jack Williams, was granted a new trial this summer after a federal judge found that prosecutors failed to reveal that an FBI agent witness had lied in another case. Williams had been convicted of covering up his knowledge of a college scholarship given by the Tyson Foundation to Espy's girlfriend.\n","classes":[12,44,90,91,104],"classes_pad":null}

{"codes":["M11","MCAT"],"headline":"Stocks soar on Fed chairman's statements.","text":"\nThe Dow Jones industrial average crashed through the 8,000-point ceiling Tuesday, propelled by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments that the economy was slowing and that inflation will be modest for the remainder of the year.\nShortly after 2:30 p.m. EDT, the 30-stock Dow was up 121.71, or 1.5 percent, at 8,028.43, which surpassed its July 16 record close of 8,038.88.\nIn the broader market, advancing issues swamped declines 2-1 on heavy volume of 420 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.\nIn his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony on the economy to Congress, Greenspan also said that the central bank must be ready to act if necessary to head off inflation, but for now economic growth seemed to be slowing.\nThe rally was just as explosive in bonds, where the Treasury's key 30-year bond jumped nearly a full point, which lowered its rate to 6.46 percent from Monday's close of 6.54 percent.\nGreenspan said: \"I have no doubt that the current stance of policy ... will need to be changed at some point. ... For the present, demand growth does appear to have moderated.\"\nHe said in his prepared text that stock market gains could fuel demand in the future.\nWall Street was happy that the Fed chief did not make any statements that hinted the Fed was planning an interest rate hike in the near future.\nSolid second-quarter earnings also helped push the stock market higher.\nPhilip Morris Cos. posted second-quarter earnings of 76 cents a share vs. 66 cents a share in last year's second quarter and in line with the First Call consensus earnings estimate. The company's stock was up 1-12\/16 to 42-5\/16.\nWalt Disney Co. rose 1-10\/16 to 76-13\/16, after reporting upbeat earnings.\nBut International Business Machines, whose stock had been strong ahead of its quarterly earnings release late Monday, fell 1-14\/16 to 101-13\/16.\n","classes":[114,123],"classes_pad":null}

Revenues rose 2 percent to $5.2 billion.\nThe quarterly results were slightly above Wall Street's consensus estimate of 67 cents a share, sending Disney's stock sharply higher. By midafternoon, it was up $1.81 to $77 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.\nIndustry analysts said Disney's broadcasting unit posted better-than-expected results, while theme parks and Disney's creative content division showed signs of slowing momentum.\nIn addition, they said Disney benefited from lower expenses and tax rates during the quarter. When the effects of the lower expenses are excluded, Disney's third-quarter profit was in line with expectations.\n\"The results for the quarter and year to date demonstrate the continued operating strength of the company,\" Chairman Michael Eisner said in a statement. \"I am particularly pleased with the performance of our creative content segment, which is benefiting from improved live-action films and the successful release of 'Hercules.'\n\"Our theme parks continue to enjoy a year of record attendance driven by the popularity of the 25th Anniversary celebration at Walt Disney World,\" Eisner added. \"Our cable operations, especially ESPN and The Disney Channel, also continue to be strong contributors to the company's results as we proceed with our worldwide expansion of those businesses.\"\nOperating income from Disney's creative content division, which includes filmmaking, video and retail outlets, rose 17 percent to $333 million, as films such as \"Con Air\", \"Scream\" and \"The English Patient\" easily outpaced the weaker year-ago offerings of \"Celtic Pride\", \"Last Dance\" and \"Eddie\". However, revenues were down 4 percent, reflecting fewer live-action films released during the quarter.\nDisney's theme parks posted record results, with revenues up 10 percent to $1.4 billion, and operating income adding 11 percent to $390 million. However, analysts said attendance growth slowed to about 3 percent to 5 percent in the third quarter from about 7 percent to 9 percent in the second quarter.\nAnalysts said attendance at Walt Disney World in Florida was up about 5 percent while Disneyland was flat to slightly lower than the year-ago period.\nFor the rest of the year, Disney's theme park business is expected to face difficult comparisons with last year's strong performance, but attendance should pick up considerably next year when Disney opens its newest park, called Animal Kingdom, next spring.\nBroadcasting revenues for the quarter increased 5 percent to $1.6 billion, and operating income rose 7 percent to $337 million.\nDisney said it was hurt by lower ratings at ABC, third among the four major broadcast television networks in viewership.\nBroadcasting was helped by strong cable results, driven by increased advertising revenues and affiliate fees at its ESPN cable sports channel and increased subscribers at Disney Channel, as well as an increase in ad revenues at the television and radio stations.\nThe company bought ABC in February 1996 and completed the purchase during the second quarter of this year. Disney posted a $225 million charge last year from the acquisition.\nThe company also recorded a $300 million charge a year ago from an accounting change, and a $135 million gain from the sale of station KCAL-TV in the first quarter of the current year. Excluding the non-recurring items, revenues for the nine-month period increased 6 percent to $17.0 billion and net income increased 27 percent to $1.5 billion, or $2.15 a share.\n","classes":[15,16,44],"classes_pad":null}

Brown & Co in New York.\nImplied demand for gasoline has averaged 8.6 million barrels per day (bpd) over the past four weeks.\nRefinery utilization capacity was expected to decline at most by one percentage point which would leave refineries running near a feverish 96 percent, implying high gasoline output.\nStill, a hurricane in the U.S. Gulf last week disrupted refinery operations and was expected to have diverted imports, limiting a stock build from high production. Gasoline stocks were seen rising by less than one million barrels.\nCrude stocks were seen declining one to two million barrels due to a force majeure in Colombia and the hurricane.\n\"The hurricane clearly must have had an impact and diverted some imports from the Gulf,\" said Bill O'Grady, energy analyst with A.G. Edwards in St. Louis.  \nGrady and other analysts said the summer driving season, when gasoline demand typically peaks, has still not ended, so it is conceivable that demand has continued at its breakneck pace.\n\"It (gasoline demand) really could continue for another week or two without a significant drop,\" said Grady.\nMeanwhile, distillate stocks, comprised of heating oil and diesel, was seen showing a seasonal rise of one to three million barrels.\n","classes":[119,122,123],"classes_pad":null}

I think there's a way to work this out and I'm hopeful that by Wednesday when the (European) Commission meets, an agreement will have been reached.\"\nClinton said the key concern in the United States is \"that only the antitrust considerations play a role in this decision and that we do everything we can to avoid a more political decision, which would lead to an unfortunate trade conflict between the United States and Europe.\"\nThe merger would cut the number of large commercial airplane producers from three to two, wrapping McDonnell Douglas's commercial airline operations into those of Boeing.\nEuropeans are concerned that a newly enlarged Boeing -- which already accounts for 60 percent of the sales of large commercial aircraft -- would enjoy an overwhelming competitive advantage over Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft consortium.\nAlthough McDonnell Douglas has many airplanes in service, it sold only about three dozen last year. When the U.S. Federal Trade Commission approved the merger earlier this month, it found McDonnell Douglas \"no longer constitutes a meaningful competitive force in the commercial aircraft market.\"\nDespite their earlier misgivings about the deal, Europeans were suddenly optimistic late Tuesday that a deal might be reached.\n\"There remains the very real possibility that it will be possible to reach agreement,\" British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in Brussels.\nHe spoke after European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert told ministers that Boeing was easing its position on its exclusive contracts to supply jetliners to major airlines.\nFor Van Miert, those exclusive 20-year supply contracts with Delta Airlines, American Airlines and Continental Airlines have been a key sticking point for months.\nThe Federal Trade Commission also raised concerns about the exclusive contracts, although it took no action.\nUntil now, Seattle-based Boeing has offered to cut the exclusive agreements to 10 years, but not to abolish them. It was unclear what the new offer from Boeing might be.\nFor Americans, the key issue has been the separation of trade and competition issues. Clinton's view that the merger should be decided on competition issues reiterates the administration view of the past few months.\nThe American position has been that trade issues -- such as a 1992 agreement over U.S. and European direct and indirect subsidies to commercial airplane makers -- must not be part of the Boeing decision.\nVan Miert has said repeatedly that only competition issues were being considered.\n","classes":[13,25,26,40,44,80,82,87,90],"classes_pad":null}

The rest of it is a 'So what?' statement about their earnings and no one seriously believes they can generate better value than UPR's bid at least in the short term,\" said one analyst who declined to be identified.\nDespite the high level of acceptances, Union Pacific still has to talk to Pennzoil's board if it wants to win the company.\nPennzoil can tie up the bid in the courts for years and has a whole range of anti-takeover measures and a poison-pill defence.\n\"Pennzoil is very concerned about the structure of the deal, the best way to eliminate that is to negotiate terms,\" said Young.\n","classes":[25,26,44],"classes_pad":null}

Mead said.\n\"In our other business, recent improvements in containerboard industry conditions, notably pricing, combined with our stringent cost-control measures, give us good reason to believe we have turned the corner in that business,\" he said.\nThe automotive unit's operating income rose 26 percent to $131 million from $104 million a year ago. Revenues increased 12 percent to $873 million from $780 million, setting a quarter-over-quarter record for the 15th straight time, it said.\nThe packaging division had operating income of $82 million vs. a year-ago income of $100 million, which excluded a $50 million gain from the sale of a paperboard mill joint venture with Caraustar Industries.\nTenneco's stock was up $1.81 at $47.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n","classes":[15,16,44],"classes_pad":null}

It had net earnings of $376 million, or $2.82 a share, on revenues of $4.38 billion.\nA year earlier, UAL earned $307 million, or $2.52 a share, on revenues of $4.16 billion.\nMinneapolis-based Northwest said its earnings fell to $136.2 million, or $1.26 a share, from $202.8 million, or $1.90 a share. Operating income slid to $291.1 million from $374.7 million.\nNorthwest's operating revenues edged up to $2.56 billion from $2.54 billion. But operating expenses rose to $2.27 billion from $2.17 billion.\n\"The reinstatement of the 10 percent ticket tax made this a particularly difficult quarter to produce year-over-year improvements in unit revenue and fully distributed earnings per share,\" UAL Chairman Gerald Greenwald said.\nUnited's domestic passenger unit revenue growth was hurt by the effects of the federal ticket tax reimposition. However, this was offset by the strength of the Atlantic and Latin America markets, the company said.\nFor the six months, UAL earned $591 million, or $4.44 a share, on revenues of $8.50 billion. A year earlier it earned $382 million, or $3.29 a share, on revenues of $7.89 billion.\nThe results reflected the company's employee stock ownership plan and were made on a \"fully distributed\" basis, it said.\nThe airline said its earnings for the full year on a fully distributed basis should modestly exceed the current analyst consensus estimate of $9.26 a share as reported by First Call.\nSeparately, United Airlines said it may resolve within the next two weeks its debate with the pilots union over which pilots will own new regional jets the company wants to buy.\nThe talks with the pilots union have been a sticking point in United's plan to purchase regional jets that would feed its hub operations and add service to smaller markets.\nThe talks centre on whether the new jets would be flown by pilots at the main airline or by pilots at the commuter airline affiliates.\n\"There is is no question that we are behind the competition on the regional jet issue. We are in intensive discussion with the Air Line Pilots Association. The dialogue has been positive and interesting,\" the company said in a conference call with reporters following its second quarter earnings report.\nNorthwest also cited the reimposition of taxes on air tickets as a reason for its profits fall. It also said the weak Japanese yen offset gains in the carrier's U.S. passenger and cargo business.\n\"Our results reflect a strong domestic performance which largely offset the estimated $80 million impact of the reimposition of the ticket tax during the second quarter,\" Northwest President John Dasburg said.\n\"Our cargo operations performed well, posting substantial increases in unit revenue. On the other hand, our Pacific business was soft and significantly impacted by a weaker yen year-over-year.\"\nNorthwest said its second-quarter cargo traffic was flat, but revenues rose 5.3 percent as yields increased.\nMaintenance costs grew because of an anticipated rise in the number of required engine and airframe overhauls during the quarter and mandated fleet campaigns. The number of engine overhauls rose 26 percent from a year ago, Northwest said.\nThe strengthening of the yen during the second quarter created non-cash charges of about $30 million in unrealized losses on yen-hedging agreements and exchange losses on net yen-denominated liabilities, it said.\nUAL stock was up $1.50 at $78 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\nNorthwest's stock was unchanged at $36 on Nasdaq.\n","classes":[15,16,44,55,56,70],"classes_pad":null}

Overall, 6,444 or 2 percent developed medical problems severe enough in the first month to require hospital treatment.\nThe comparative risk of having to return to the hospital rose as the first month progressed. The risk was as much as 25 percent higher among babies of first-time mothers discharged within 30 hours of delivery compared with firstborns kept for 30 to 78 hours. Mothers younger than 18 and those whose membranes broke prematurely also had at-risk babies.\nThe infants that required hospital treatment suffered from various ailments including jaundice, dehydration and sepsis.\nLiu said her findings justified legislation passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton mandating insurance coverage for a minimum 48-hour hospital stay for newborns.\n\"While the recent national legislation was a first step in recognising the importance of this vulnerable period, our findings underscore the additional need for careful assessment of newborns just prior to discharge and close individual follow-up within the first days of life,\" Liu wrote.\nBut a narrower study also published in the Journal found newborns discharged within one or two days of delivery did not have a higher risk of needing hospital treatment for feeding-related problems compared with those discharged after three days.\nThe University of Wisconsin at Madison study did find that the risk of hospital readmission was higher among firstborns, breast-fed infants, pre-term babies, and among babies of poorly educated, unmarried, or poverty-stricken mothers.\nIn a commentary, Paula Braveman of the University of California at San Francisco wrote that good judgment and good science should determine when newborns are released.\n\"Good clinical judgment, based on careful consideration of available evidence, suggests that the difference between a postpartum stay of 24 hours and a stay of 48 hours is unlikely to be a critical determinant of newborn or maternal health outcomes, although the difference between 1-2 days and 3-4 days may be significant,\" Braveman wrote.\n","classes":[90,99],"classes_pad":null}

Authority for the work expires later this year, making legislative action necessary.\nAt a House Agriculture subcommittee hearing, Bob Johnson, head of USDA's Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, laid out the department's proposal to update its research portfolio.\n\"We propose that Congress authorize a new, competitive grant program to invest in a National Food Genone Strategy,\" Johnson said, suggesting funding of $50 million a year in fiscal 1999-2002. It would speed up ongoing work on food crops and livestock.\n\"Through accelerated research, the program will identify and develop a functional understanding of genes responsible for economically important traits in plants, animals and microbes of importance to agriculture,\" Johnson said.\nUSDA's package also proposed a requirement that at least 25 percent of extension formula funds be devoted to multi-state, regional or national activities. Johnson said the change would encourage collaboration and efficiency.\nMembers of the Senate Agriculture Committee were working on a package that, in most cases, would require scientists to devote their attention to projects with a wide audience and to require one-fourth of funds to be spent in multi-state work.\n\"I think we're moving in the same direction,\" committee chairman Richard Lugar, Indiana Republican, said in discussing the committee's goals and the USDA plan.\nLugar said the effort to write a Senate bill was \"in the final innings...We are making good headway.\" An aide said the committee might hold a bill-drafting meeting in the next couple of weeks.\nThe House Agriculture subcommittee began its round of hearings a few weeks ago. Its leaders have echoed the Senate panel in saying they were willing to consider a major overhaul of federal research rules.\nAlong with the genome mapping project and the proposal for more multistate work, key points in the USDA package were:\n--extending the life of the $100 million a year Fund for Rural America, which supports research and rural economic development. The 1996 farm policy law set a lifetime of three years. USDA called for funding for one and possibly two more years.\n--creating a new competitive grant program for integrated research, extension and education projects. A 100 percent match for federal funds would be required on projects that did not have a national or regional application.\n--allowing land grant universities, a major force in ag research, to redirect up to 10 percent of all their research and extension formula funds to any research or extension project. Flexibility would increase to 15 percent in fiscal 1999, 20 percent in FY 2000 and 25 percent in 2001 and 2002.\n--permitting USDA, National Weather Service and state and local entities to operate a National Agricultural Weather Information System. The Weather Service ended its agricultural weather work in April 1996 with \"significant negative effect on agriculture,\" Johnson said.\n--making historically black and Indian land grant universities eligible for extension funds.

Annan's spokesman later said the Secretariat would complete the aid plan review by the end of July.

Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said in a telephone interview. \"But no decision has been made.\"\nThe $1.3 trillion municipal bond market has been rocked by recent charges that bond underwriters overbill issuers for U.S. Treasuries bought in the open market and used in bond financing transactions, a practice known as yield burning.\nIn July 1996, the Internal Revenue Service notified municipalities that they can avoid having their bonds declared taxable by settling any overcharges with the Service.\nBut furious issuers said IRS should be barred from acting against municipalities that did not know about or profit from yield burning in their bonds, and that help U.S. enforcement officials nab bond underwriters that did.\nGrassley, who sits on both the Senate Finance and Judiciary Committees, proposed a solution this February. He urged the U.S. Justice Department in a letter to invoke the 1986 False Claims Act to recover millions of alleged yield burning profits from Wall Street.\nThe 1986 false claims law permits the U.S. government to bring action against any party that causes financial loss to the Treasury. Justice theoretically could seek treble damages and penalties against bond firms in such cases.\nThe strategy would take the weight off issuers who are being pressured under the IRS' 1996 \"revenue procedure\" to pay off yield burning debts.\nFrustrated muni groups have met with Treasury officials and Vice President Al Gore on the issue, but no policy change has been announced.

The county emerged from bankruptcy one year ago.  \nHoping to recover the funds it lost, the county filed a civil lawsuit against Merrill Lynch, alleging it sold the county risky securities in violation of law. The case is scheduled to go to trial in September 1998.\nMerrill Lynch has denied any wrongdoing and is contesting the county's allegations in court.\nThe Orange County district attorney's investigation of the bankruptcy crisis took a surprising turn in June when Merrill Lynch agreed to pay $30 million to settle the probe. The settlement ensured Merrill Lynch and its employees would not face criminal charges, prosecutors said.  \nInitially, prosecutors said they would try to find a way to unseal transcripts from the grand jury's investigation. The district attorney's office later announced that it could not release the files because no indictments were issued.\nA hearing has been set for July 30 in Orange County Superior Court to debate the issue.\nCounty attorneys argued that the grand jury transcripts should be released because they would be of \"substantial benefit to the court in determining the truth in the Merrill Lynch civil action.\"  \nOrange County prosecutors said the law does not allow them to release the grand jury testimony.\n\"Simply put, the transcription and release of the sought-after grand jury transcripts, would be without legal authority,\" Wallace Wade, an assistant Orange County district attorney, said in a recent court filing. \"The law simply does not permit testimony or evidence to be made public when it was taken in closed, non-public sessions ... and no indictment or accusation was returned.\"\nMerrill Lynch declined to comment on the transcripts.\n((--Adam Entous, 415-677-2511))\n","classes":[12,19,44,55,57,70,90,91],"classes_pad":null}

The county emerged from bankruptcy one year ago.\nHoping to recover the funds it lost, the county filed a civil lawsuit against Merrill Lynch, alleging it sold the county risky securities in violation of law. The case is scheduled to go to trial in September 1998.\nMerrill Lynch has denied any wrongdoing and is contesting the county's allegations in court.\nThe battle for grand jury transcripts began after Merrill Lynch settled with Orange County District Attorney Michael Capizzi in June. The $30 million settlement ensured Merrill Lynch and its employees would not face criminal charges.\nInitially, Capizzi said county prosecutors would try to unseal transcripts from the grand jury's investigation. But prosecutors later announced that they could not release the files because no indictments were issued.\n\"Simply put, the transcription and release of the sought-after grand jury transcripts would be without legal authority,\" Wallace Wade, an assistant Orange County district attorney, said in court papers filed this week. \"The law simply does not permit testimony or evidence to be made public when it was taken in closed, non-public sessions ... and no indictment or accusation was returned.\"\nCounty attorneys said Tuesday the transcripts should be released because they would be of \"substantial benefit to the court in determining the truth in the Merrill Lynch civil action.\"\nCounty lawyers also argued that the public has a right to know what the grand jury investigation turned up.\n\"The public deserves to understand and be informed of the full course of events leading up to the financial collapse, including both the actions of its public officials and those who acted in concert with them, to determine who bears responsibility and how to ensure that such events do not recur,\" lawyers for the county said in their court filing.\n\"The policies favouring disclosure of the transcripts far outweigh the policies surrounding grand jury secrecy,\" they said.\nA hearing has been set for July 30 in Orange County Superior Court to debate the issue.\nMerrill Lynch declined to comment on the transcripts.\n","classes":[12,19,44,55,57,70,90,91],"classes_pad":null}

The dollar also rose sharply.\nWith less threat of higher interest rates that might lure investors out of stocks and bonds, there was little incentive to invest in gold, analysts said.\nAfter the market closed, Greenspan said falling gold prices reflected declining inflation expectations more than central bank sales, while consumer surveys also suggested a hefty decline in popular expectations of future price gains.\n\"The extraordinary decline in the price of gold is probably only a small part due to sales by central banks,\" Greenspan said. \"We are now beginning also to see a very marked decline in long-term inflation expectations.\"\nGold fell to a 12-year low early this month of $315.75 in London after news of a sale of 167 tons by the Australian central bank.\nCrude oil fell on selling linked to the expiration of the August contract.

It also has an agreement to place debt service funds into an escrow account at First Union National Bank for transfer to the bond trustee.\nUnder the draft plan, the special assessments would be collected by the Dade County tax collector and the escrow agreement would be expanded so that the county could forward that money to the escrow account.\nMarquez said any attempt to spread the bond debt obligation countywide probably would not survive a legal challenge.\n\"The people throughout the county cannot pick up the obligations that benefitted the (former Miami) group,\" Marquez said. \"It's not equitable.\"\nThe plan calls for city parks to be transferred to the county or sold, although some land could be transferred to an environmental trust.\nIt also calls for the sale of all other city assets, including land and buildings, that are not under contract.

Slade Gorton, the top Republican on the subcommittee in charge of the bill.\nIn contrast to the House, which wiped out funding for the NEA, the Senate panel approved $100 million for the agency that gives grants to community orchestras, theatres, filmmakers and other artists. But the Committee chairman, Sen. Ted Stevens, predicted that the money would be questioned on the Senate floor.\nAlso unlike the House, the Senate committee approved $700 million for land acquisition, including $250 million to save the Headwaters Grove in California, the nation's largest remaining uncut old-growth forest, and $65 million to pay a company not to develop a mine on the edge of Yellowstone National Park.\nMoney for the two land purchases hinges on approval from another Senate committee, although the administration believes it only needs spending clearance from Congress to go ahead with the deals that it negotiated, Gorton said.\nThe bill met the White House request to step up spending on Native American programmes by $76 million to $757 million for the 1998 fiscal year and funds energy research and development at $364 million, close to this year's level.\nTo help cover some of the increases, the bill called for selling $207.5 million of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to cover the operating costs of the stockpile.\nThe administration said it opposed the sale, which would be the fourth one in the last two years, but Gorton said it would be difficult to avoid, especially since the House had envisioned the need for a $209 million sale.\n\"I deeply hope that this is the last time we will have to deal with the operations of the national strategic petroleum reserve in this manner,\" he said.\nStevens said he expected the interior spending bill to reach the Senate floor in September rather than before Congress goes on recess in August, because senators need to resolve some contentious issues involving spending on hardrock mining regulations and allocations to Native American tribes.\n","classes":[55,56,70,90,96,104],"classes_pad":null}

Informix stock jumped $1.09 to $10.81 on Nasdaq on speculation that White would bring in help to run the company.\nFinocchio, 46, will try to improve the software company's operations to make the business more predictable, he said in an interview, while White will focus on the company's long-term strategy.\nFinocchio said his first priority will be to shore up the company's operations and set a clear strategy to keep customers' confidence.\n\"The second priority (is to) build financial strength and stability, to build a plan to get to a sustainable financial model, to shore up the balance sheet,\" he said.\nFinocchio was most recently president of 3Com's systems unit, which makes complex gear for big corporate networks. He was one of the managers who helped 3Com expand in the early 1990s into new markets, Informix said.\nInformix also is looking for a chief financial officer. The previous CFO, Alan Henricks, quit the company in April shortly after it reported a $140.1 million loss on revenue of $133.7 million.\n","classes":[41,42,44],"classes_pad":null}

Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat.\nUnder existing rules, each pollution credit issued by the Environmental Protection Agency permits a power plant to emit one ton of sulfur dioxide. Under the legislation, each utility would have to give up half their allowances.\nThe bill would also seek to establish a cap on emissions of nitrogen oxides, which also contribute to acid rain, and set up a NOx allowance trading system.\nThe New York senators are pushing the plan in response to environmentalists' concerns that the Environmental Protection Agency's acid rain program has failed to ease severe problems in Adirondack Park.\n\"Moynihan before the August recess will introduce a bill that addresses most of the problems right now with acid deposition,\" said his spokesman Dan Maffei.\nThe proposal comes at a time when the EPA has been touting the success of its SO2 emissions trading program in helping to combat acid rain cheaply and is using the program as a model for cutting nitrogen oxides to control smog.\nThe combination of emissions trading, technology advances and the availability of cleaner coal has helped utilities nationwide to cut acid rain pollution more than required under the Clean Air Act and at lower costs than predicted.\nThe law requires power plants to cut their SO2 and NOx emissions in half from 1990 levels, but green groups say that will not be enough to improve the health of the Adirondack Park, a state park which is the nation's largest park in the lower 48 states.\n\"We don't believe the 50 percent reduction nationwide is going to result in a 50 percent reduction in our airshed,\" said John Sheehan, a spokesman for the Adirondack Council, an environmental group.\nHe said that even with strict new limits on smog and soot set last week by the EPA, the Adirondacks would still be in trouble. \"Our target is to protect the ecological systems of the Adirondack Park that are perishing as we speak,\" he said.\nNew York Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, last week introduced legislation that aims to stop clean power plants in the state which have thousands of unneeded pollution allowances from selling their credits to coal-burning utilities in the Midwest that are blowing smog into the state.\nAt the same time, the state is suing the EPA for failing to set acid deposition standards to regulate emissions from Midwestern smokestacks.\nEPA officials in New York and Washington refused to comment on the proposed legislation and the lawsuit.\n\"We aren't going to comment until we've had a chance to review the bill,\" an EPA spokesman said.\n-- Sonali Paul, (202) 898-8320\n","classes":[90,97,104],"classes_pad":null}

They added that the problem had been fixed.\n\"We have received all of the data in 2-1\/2 weeks that we expected to receive in the first month. We have completely fulfilled our primary objectives,\" said an obviously delighted Matthew Golombek, the project scientist.\nAsked what children could expect to do if they were lucky enough to land on Mars, the man in charge of the photographic part of the mission, Pete Smith, said, \"Kids would have a great time on Mars\" as long as they were equipped with the right protective clothing and oxygen masks.\nSmith envisaged a cosmic sandlot for them.\n\"Given that Mars' gravity is one third that on Earth, they could clear three-foot (one metre) rocks with ease, and they could stomp in the Martian sand and create mini-duststorms around their legs,\" he said.\nBut with words of caution, he added, \"I think the parents wouldn't be too pleased; this red dust stains like nothing you have ever seen.\"\nSmith's solution: \"Have the kids wear red outfits.\" Oh, and no sunbathing. Even in the Martian tropics, where the Pathfinder landing site is located, the afternoon highs are still a sub-freezing 4 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 15 Centigrade).\nLooking back on the first 17 \"Sols\", or Martian days, which are 24 minutes longer than Earth days, mission manager Richard Cook said, \"The lander and the rover have performed beyond our wildest expectations. I would like to take back a few of the (communications) problems we have had, but they haven't affected our ability to carry out the mission.\"\nGolombek added, \"We have had an excellent week on Mars.\"\nThe little six-wheeled rover -- about the size of a microwave oven -- had performed an \"aggressive series of manoeuvres\" including kicking up soil in an area known as the Cabbage Patch to see what the subsoil looked like, and performing an analysis on a white rock called Scooby Doo with its alpha proton X-ray spectrometer to determine its composition.\nScooby Doo is of particular interest to the Pathfinder team because it is one of only two white rocks that can be seen from the landing sight in the Ares Vallis basin. Results of the analysis were being studied at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory on Tuesday.\nSmith theorised that the whiteness might be a crust formed by minerals after flood waters receded billions of years ago.\nScientists believe a catastrophic flood covered much of the planet billion of years ago and Smith said further evidence of this were big, rounded boulders whose angles had been knocked off as they were carried by the floodwaters.\nHe said they may have come from Mars' ancient highlands, making them much older than rocks native to the Ares Vallis basin. A third type of rock photographed by the Pathfinder lander were blue, angled rocks probably spewed out by volcanoes.\nBut one rock, dubbed Yogi, has scientists puzzled, it is blue on one side and red on the other. \"A bit like an old '50s Buick,\" said Smith.

John Warner, the Virginia Republican who as chairman of the Senate rules committee is heading up the investigation, said he wants to extend it until Sept. 9. He said he wants up to $450,000 to fund the investigation, and will seek information about the influx of gambling industry money into the state campaign.\nWarner acknowledged at a news conference that the probe so far has not found evidence of irregularities that would have affected the outcome of the tight race, in which Democrat Mary Landrieu defeated Republican Louis \"Woody\" Jenkins.\nWarner argued that it would actually be in the Democrats' interest to pursue the investigation further so that there would be no lingering doubts about Landrieu.\nBut Democrats said that seven months of investigation without finding significant wrongdoing is enough. They say it has degenerated into a witchhunt, casting unfair shadows over Landrieu's integrity.\n\"This investigation is out of money, out of time and we're out of patience,\" Kentucky Sen. Wendell Ford, the ranking Democrat on the Rules committee, told reporters. \"The big hunt is over and they haven't bagged a thing.\"\nDemocrats had already said they will no longer cooperate with the investigation. Tuesday Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat, added a threat to block Senate committee hearings and certain legislation if the probe does not end.\n\"We will no longer tolerate this investigation,\" Daschle said.\nWarner said that at least one Democrat is still trying to bridge the gap and negotiate a compromise.\n","classes":[90,91,104,111],"classes_pad":null}

In May, the government had a $48.49 billion deficit.\nThe surplus exceeded Wall Street economists' expectations, but was in line with a prediction of the Congressional Budget Office in an analysis dated July 9 and issued on July 17. The record budget surplus for any month was $93.94 billion this past April, a month in which revenues are always high because of the tax filing deadline.\nWith the government awash in unexpected cash, the deficit through the first nine months of fiscal year 1997, which ends on Sept. 30, fell 85 percent to $10.87 billion from $74.02 billion at the same point in 1996.\nMany economists expect fiscal 1997 to wind up with a modest budget deficit of about $50 billion, after a $106.99 billion in 1996. They expect it to fade completely by the end of next year if current policy is left unchanged by the Congress and the White House.\nIronically, a budget deal, which includes tax and spending cuts that are still being hashed out, could widen the deficit next year, even though it would wipe out the budget shortfall by the year 2002.\nWhite House Budget Director Franklin Raines has called the idea of letting the budget balance itself without a five-year agreement \"absurd\" and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said Tuesday that any naturally occurring balanced budget would not last long.\nBoth officials said an agreement is needed on taxes and spending to ensure that a balanced budget can be sustained.\nThe last time the United States posted a budget surplus was 1969.\nThe Clinton administration has forecast a deficit of $125.59 billion for this year, but it is expected to issue a revised forecast later.\nIn June, total outlays were $118.84 billion, down from $142.99 billion in May but up slightly from $117.66 billion in June 1996.\nRevenues rose to $173.36 billion in June from $94.49 billion in May and $152 billion in June 1996.\nSo far in this fiscal year, government outlays totalled $1.202 trillion against revenues of $1.192 trillion.

The dollar fell against the yen, closing at 114.95\/00 yen against 116.00\/10.\nGreenspan's remarks added additional fuel to a dollar\/mark rally which began overseas because of mounting doubts about the strength of the euro.  \nThese doubts were initially sparked on Monday when a French budget audit showed the country would fail to bring its budget deficit within the required 3.0 percent of gross domestic product for entry into monetary union.\nOn Tuesday, German officials appeared to welcome French plans to hike taxes on big business and cut spending in order to get closer to the 3.0 percent target, while shrugging off the importance of meeting that precise level.  \nEuro doubts were further exacerbated when Bundesbank council member Hans-Juergen Koebnick told German radio on Tuesday that the euro could be stable even if Germany and France missed the targets.\n\"I think it's clear in the wake of this French audit and tax proposal that the euro is going to go ahead on time and we'll have a soft beginning,\" said David Gilmore, partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics.\n\"We have numerous Bundesbank officials saying France is doing all it can to meet the criteria and that that is enough.\"  \nIn addition to its slide against the dollar, the slumping mark also dropped to its lowest level against the British pound in 81-months, and fell to 10-month lows against the Swiss franc.\nSterling\/mark ended at its peak of 3.0475\/85 and mark\/Swiss at a low of 0.8132\/35.\nDealers attributed the dollar's poor performance against the yen to the Japanese currency's strength against the mark and to continuing flight from ailing exotic Asian currencies to the yen.\nBesieged Southeast Asian currencies stabilized somewhat on Tuesday after weeks of speculative selling, but traders said further damage could be forthcoming.\nIn other trade on Tuesday, the dollar fell to 1.4825\/35 Swiss francs from 1.4852\/62 at the open, and edged down to Canadian $1.3787\/92 from C$1.3796\/01.\nThe British pound rose to $1.6798\/08 from $1.6760\/70 and the Australian dollar inched down to $0.7395\/00 from $0.7397\/02.\n(( -- Noah Barkin, N.A.

Revenues rose slightly, to $11.5 billion from $11.3 billion a year ago.\nThe latest results included a one-time gain of $131 million, while the year-ago results included a one-time gain of $224 million.\n\"These earnings were much better than had been forecast, they were even stronger than ... we were forecasting, which had been at the top of the range,\" said Eugene Nowak, analyst at ABN AMRO First Chicago Corp.\nThe earnings, which surpassed industry analysts estimates by some 7 percent, drove Texaco's stock price up $3.25 a share, to $113.875 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\nTexaco Chairman Peter Bijur said a surplus of refined products, especially on the West Coast, and sluggish market demand drove prices lower, \"negating the effects of improved refining operations and higher gasoline sales volumes.\"\nEarnings were also hurt by a year-on-year decline in crude oil prices, which lopped $35 million off Texaco's exploration and production income, to $311 million for the quarter.\nTexaco's U.S. refining, marketing and distribution operating earnings, excluding special items. tumbled 40 percent to $87 million in the quarter, down from $144 million a year ago.\n\"While the U.S. downstream number of $87 million looks terrible, you have to remember that the year-ago figure was a robust quarter,\" said Nowak.\nBut the decline in both U.S. refining profits and exploration and production worldwide was partially offset by stronger results in its overseas refining business, the company said.\nFor the first half of 1997, Texaco's net income totalled $1.55 billion, or $5.86 per share, compared with $1.08 billion, or $4.01 per share, in the first half of 1996.\nOil giant Amoco Corp. also topped analysts' expectations for the quarter, aided by stronger refining margins and increased output of petroleum products and chemicals.\nChicago-based Amoco said its profits climbed nearly 4 percent, to $622 million, or $1.26 per share, from $600 million, or $1.20 per share, in the year-ago quarter.\nAnalysts had forecast earnings of $1.18 per share. The company's stock rose $1.75 to $90 a share in consolidated NYSE trading.\nFor Amoco, the nation's fourth biggest oil company, the main gain came from its U.S. refining operations, which earned $185 million during the second quarter, compared with $119 million a year ago.\nAmoco also benefited from strong returns in its chemicals operations, where earnings rose to $185 million from $173 million a year ago.\nRevenues edged down to $8.6 billion, from $8.8 billion a year ago, Amoco said.\nOn Monday, Exxon said its second-quarter profits rose by 25 percent, to $1.97 billion, from $1.57 billion a year earlier, bolstered by higher margins in its refining and chemical businesses.\n","classes":[15,16,44],"classes_pad":null}

The shift is that the emphasis now is on the structural changes,\" said senior economist Ethan Harris at Lehman Government Securities.\n\"The themes are not different but the emphasis is a lot different. Greenspan is leaving the door open to the notion we can live with a 5.0-percent unemployment rate,\" Harris noted while pointing out the Fed's forecast for the jobless rate in 1997 and 1998 is between 4.75 and 5.0 percent.\n\"This is symptomatic of the thinking at the Fed that the unemployment rate will be around 5.0 percent for some time and it's something the economy can live with,\" Harris added.  \nHarris, a former New York Fed economist, said Greenspan would have delivered \"a more hawkish speech if they believed they could not live with that kind of jobless number.\"\nIn the question-and-answer session in Congress, Greenspan reiterated the long-term U.S. economic structure is changing, although it is unclear how significant the changes are.\nAnalysts agreed U.S. productivity may be understated -- meaning growth may run above 2.0 percent withough inflation.\n\"Higer productivity is a structural change, yes, but who knows how much is the change,\" said William Dudley, chief economist at Goldman, Sachs and Co.  \n\"Productivity growth is higher. This is a good way to explain the strong growth in corporate profits. But to be really bailed out of the inflation problem would be to have continuous increases in productivity,\" stressed Dudley who warned this was an unrealistic scenario.\n\"Higher productivity postpones the day of the inflation reckoning but if does not prevent it,\" Dudley added while pointing noting this accounted for Greenspan's caution.\nDeutsche Morgan Grenfell chief fixed-income economist Joe Carson agreed \"the price\/wage relation tells you NAIRU, the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, did change.\"  \nCarson noted that Greenspan acknowledged technology's role in bringing about changes in productivity while retaining his typical caution in pronouncing the magnitude of the changes.\n\"Greenspan basically said there are still limits on growth and that the Fed is not involved in an experiment,\" Carson concluded.\nWilliam Griggs, managing director at Griggs and Santow, noted \"there was nothing of the aggressiveness we heard from Greenspan in February. He is giving voice to the view that there is something different in this expansion.\"\nGriggs added the \"Fed clearly had to come down on the NAIRU. They recognized the possibility of a lower tradeoff.\"\nGriggs also said that assessing the growth\/inflation relation is complicated by the failure of macroeconomic models.\n\"They thought the growth of the economy and the low level of unemployment would bring inflation. This has not happened.

Freeport Indonesia Co (PT-FI) achieved excellent operating results during the second quarter, with mill throughput averaging a quarterly record 130,800 metric tonnes of ore per day.  \nMill throughput is expected to continue between 125,000-130,000 tonnes daily until completion of the fourth concentrator mill expansion, Freeport Copper said.\nFreeport said PT-FI has commitments for essentially all of its expected 1997 concentrate sales, which are now estimated to total at least 1.1 billion pounds of copper and 1.65 million ounces of gold.  Third and fourth-quarter 1997 copper sales are projected to approximate second quarter levels.\nDuring the quarter, PT-FI sold 305.9 million pounds of copper and 431,700 ounces of gold.  This compares with 269.2 million and 269.2 million, respectively, a year earlier.  \nIt said this boosted second-quarter net income per share to $0.35, more than double the $0.15 earned a year earlier.\nFirst Call consensus for the quarter was $0.34.\nNet income, before preferred dividends, rose to $79.1 million from $42.7 million last year.\nDuring the latest quarter, the company said, it benefited from the re-pricing of \"open\" concentrate sales, primarily because of higher copper prices; the sale, net of acquisition costs, of copper put option contracts; and copper and gold forward sales contracts.  \nSecond-quarter revenues include favorable adjustments to March 31 open concentrate sales totaling $23.3 million, the company said.  It said this added $11.3 million, or $0.06 per share, to net income.\nAt June 30, copper sales totaling 304.0 million pounds, which were recorded at an average price of $1.06 per pound, remained to be finally priced.   About 60 percent of these\nopen pounds are expected to be finally priced during the third quarter of 1997, with most of the remaining pounds to be priced during the fourth quarter.\nFreeport said a $0.01 change in the average price used for these open pounds would have an approximate $1.3 million effect on 1997 net income.\nIt said PT-FI's cash production costs, after gold and silver credits, averaged $0.290 per pound of copper during the second quarter.\nIt said unit production and delivery costs are expected to decline in the second half of 1997 because of higher second half sales of copper.  For the full year, costs are estimated to approximate the 1996 average.  Additionally, gold credits in the second half of the year, which will be influenced by gold prices, could benefit from higher gold grades.\n((-- New York Newsdesk 212 859-1610))\n","classes":[15,18,33,44],"classes_pad":null}

Two alleged accomplices, Jose Medina, 51, and Boris Sabas, 42, were also named defendants in the case.\nProsecutors introduced as evidence recorded telephone conversations and letters in which Jackson contacted Cosby's lawyer, his publisher, CBS and Cosby's television sponsors, and threatened to expose the actor as a deadbeat dad unless she received money.\nDuring closing arguments, assistant U.S. attorney Paul Engelmayer alleged Jackson threatened to ruin Cosby's reputation \"over and over again\" and showed that the was \"ready, willing and able\" to take her story to the news media.\n\"She was an extortionist driven by greed,\" he said.\nAs part of the scheme, Jackson provided Cosby's lawyer and the former president of CBS with an unsigned contract with the Globe supermarket tabloid in which she would sell her story for $25,000.\nEnglemayer said the fact the contract was unsigned made it a threat with the message \"I'm one signature away from ruining your reputation.\"\n\"The defendants did not want to get money the old fashioned way by working. They wanted to get rich quick,\" Engelmayer told the Manhattan federal jury.\nBut Jackson's lawyer Robert Baum described Jackson as \"naive\" and a \"petulant child\" who desperately needed money to survive.

The Anderson plant has about 2,500 workers who produce tail lamps and brake lights for nearly all of GM's North American vehicles.\nA strike at either plant could quickly disrupt GM's North American production. Two strikes during the second quarter have already cost the No. 1 U.S. automaker $490 million in lost profits.\nThe main issues are the same ones that GM and union leaders have grappled with all year. Union leaders want GM to add more workers to provide relief from overtime and limit how much work it sends to outside contractors. GM says it needs to pare back its work force and boost manufacturing efficiencies to stay competitive.\nA new national contract was signed last November. But the conflicts over staffing and outsourcing have led to five strikes by union locals this year. Several other contracts went to the point of strike deadlines before new agreements were reached. Of GM's 105 UAW locals, about 10 still do not have new contracts.\nA recorded message at Local 663 said progress was made during talks over the weekend.\n\"The pace of the negotiations picked up considerably over the weekend and significant progress was made,\" the message said, adding that \"much work\" still needs to be done.\nGM spokeswoman Sharon Morton said bargainers worked late into the evening Monday and continued to talk Tuesday. She declined to characterise the talks.\nAt Warren, GM spokeswoman Christine D'Angela said both sides worked late before resuming the talks.\n\"The talks are continuing. We're bargaining in good faith and we want to reach a local contract,\" she said.\nJim Marcum, financial secretary at Local 909, said picket signs have already been drawn up and strikers will walk off the job if union leaders issue the order. \"We're prepared just in case,\" he said.\nLast Friday, 5,850 workers from UAW Local 594 approved a settlement with GM, ending a strike at the Pontiac, Mich., full-size pickup truck plant that began April 22.\nAs part of the new accord, GM agreed to add 557 new production and skilled trades workers and pay a total of $9.5 million to settle grievances and cover missed holiday pay.\nIn the meantime, GM suspended production of its Chevrolet Malibu and Oldsmobile Cutlass sedans at the Oklahoma City car plant because of a quality problem.\nGM spokesman Vince Muniga said production was halted as of the first shift Tuesday. The quality problem, which he would not identify, affected a \"very small percentage\" of vehicles. It was discovered Friday by an internal auditing procedure.\nMuniga said no cars have been shipped since then.\nThe plant typically produces 800 cars a day.

The shutdown was one of a series the plant has suffered since early 1995 due to equipment and safety concerns.\nMaine Yankee's current utility owners decided in April to suspend repair activities while they looked for a buyer. The owners said the facility would likely be shut down permanently if no buyer is found by early fall.\nDespite that decision, representatives of Maine Yankee were scheduled to discuss a proposed solution for the cable issue with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Tuesday. Peco has reviewed the repair plan.\nMcNeill said among the unresolved issues is who will pay the multimillion dollar bill for the plant's decommissioning. The facility's license expires in 2010, but McNeill said Peco would likely request a four-year extension.\nState and local officials may asked for tax breaks. McNeill was scheduled to meet with Gov. Angus King who on Monday expressed concern about the tax idea but has pledged to help with keeping the plant open.\nPeco is continuing to pursue the possible purchase of other U.S. nuclear facilities, but McNeill denied a reporter's suggestion the real reason their real goal in considering Maine Yankee was to set a \"market price\" for troubled nuclear plants.\nMaine Yankee is 38 percent owned by Central Maine Power Co, 20 percent each by New England Electric System and Northeast Utilities, and 22 percent by other New England utilities.\n","classes":[25,27,44],"classes_pad":null}

The economy is now in the seventh consecutive year of expansion, making it the third longest post-World-War-II cyclical upswing to date.\nMoreover, our Federal Reserve Banks indicate that economic activity is on the rise, and at a relatively high level, in virtually every geographic region and community of the nation. The expansion has been balanced, in that inventories, as well as stocks of business capital and other durable assets, have been kept closely in line with spending, so overhangs have been small and readily corrected.\nThis strong expansion has produced a remarkable increase in work opportunities for Americans. A net of more than thirteen million jobs has been created since the current period of growth began in the spring of 1991. As a consequence, the unemployment rate has fallen to 5 percent--its lowest level in almost a quarter century. The expansion has  enabled many in the working-age population, a large number of whom would have otherwise remained out of the labor force or among the longer-term unemployed, to acquire work experience and improved skills. Our whole economy will benefit from their greater productivity. To be sure, not all segments of our population are fully sharing in the economic improvement. Some Americans still have trouble finding jobs, and for part of our work force real wage stagnation persists.  \nIn contrast to the typical postwar business cycle, measured price inflation is lower now than when the expansion began and has shown little tendency to rebound of late, despite high rates of resource utilization. In the business sector, producer prices have fallen in each of the past six months. Consumers also are enjoying low inflation. The consumer price index rose at less than a 2 percent annual rate over the first half of the year, down from a little over 3 percent in 1996.\nWith the economy performing so well for so long, financial markets have been buoyant, as memories of past business and financial cycles fade with time. Soaring prices in the stock market have been fueled by moderate long-term interest rates and expectations of investors that profit margins and earnings growth will hold steady, or even increase further, in a relatively stable, low-inflation environment. Credit spreads at depository institutions and in the open market have remained extremely narrow by historical standards, suggesting a high degree of confidence among lenders regarding the prospects for credit repayment.\nThe key questions facing financial markets and policymakers are What is behind the good performance of the economy and Will it persist. Without question, the exceptional economic situation reflects some temporary factors that have been restraining inflation rates. In addition, however, important pieces of information, while just suggestive at this point, could be read as indicating basic improvements in the longer-term efficiency of our economy. The Federal Reserve has been aware of this possibility in our monetary policy deliberations and, as always, has operated with a view to supplying adequate liquidity to allow the economy to reach its highest potential on a sustainable basis.\nNonetheless, we also recognize that the capacity of our economy to produce goods and services is not without limit. If demand were to outrun supply, inflationary imbalances would eventually develop that would tend to undermine the current expansion and inhibit the long-run growth potential of the economy. Because monetary policy works with a significant lag, policy actions are directed at a future that may not be clearly evident in current experience. This leads to policy judgments that are by their nature calibrated to the relative probabilities of differing outcomes. We moved the federal funds rate higher in March because we perceived the probability of demand outstripping supply to have increased to a point where inaction would have put at risk the solid elements of support that have sustained this expansion and made it so beneficial.  \nIn making such judgments in March and in the future, we need to analyze carefully the various forces that may be affecting the balance of supply and demand in the economy, including those that may be responsible for its exceptional recent behavior. The remainder of my testimony will address the various possibilities.\nInflation, Output, and Technological Change in the 1990s Many observers, including us, have been puzzled about how an economy, operating at high levels and drawing into employment increasingly less experienced workers, can still produce subdued and, by some measures even falling, inflation rates. It will, doubtless, be several years before we know with any conviction the full story of the surprisingly benign combination of output and prices that has marked the business expansion of the last six years.\nCertainly, public policy has played an important role. Administration and Congressional actions to curtail budget deficits have enabled long-term interest rates to move lower, encouraging private efficiency-enhancing capital investment. Deregulation in a number of industries has fostered competition and held down prices. Finally, the preemptive actions of the Federal Reserve in 1994 contained a potentially destabilizing surge in demand, short-circuiting a boom-bust business cycle in the making and keeping inflation low to encourage business innovation. But the fuller explanation of the recent extraordinary performance may well lie deeper. In February 1996, I raised before this Committee a hypothesis tying together technological change and cost pressures that could explain what was even then a puzzling quiescence of inflation. The new information received in the last eighteen months remains consistent with those earlier notions; indeed, some additional pieces of the puzzle appear to be falling into place.\nA surge in capital investment in high tech equipment that began in early 1993 has since strengthened. Purchases of computer and telecommunications equipment have risen at a more than 14 percent annual rate since early 1993 in nominal terms, and at an astonishing rate of nearly 25 percent in real terms, reflecting the fall in the prices of this equipment. Presumably companies have come to perceive a significant increase in profit opportunities from exploiting the improved productivity of these new technologies.\nIt is premature to judge definitively whether these business perceptions are the harbinger of a more general and persistent improvement in productivity. Supporting this possibility, productivity growth, which often suffers as business expansions mature, has not followed that pattern. In addition, profit margins remain high in the face of pickups in compensation growth, suggesting that businesses continue to find new ways to enhance their efficiency. Nonetheless, although the anecdotal evidence is ample and manufacturing productivity has picked up, a change in the underlying trend is not yet reflected in our conventional data for the whole economy.  \nBut even if the perceived quicker pace of application of our newer technologies turns out to be mere wheel-spinning rather than true productivity advance, it has brought with it a heightened sense of job insecurity and, as a consequence, subdued wage gains. As I pointed out here last February, polls indicated that despite the significant fall in the unemployment rate, the proportion of workers in larger establishments fearful of being laid off rose from 25 percent in 1991 to 46 percent by 1996. It should not have been surprising then that strike activity in the 1990s has been lower than it has been in decades and that new labor union contracts have been longer and have given greater emphasis to job security. Nor should it have been unexpected that the number of workers voluntarily leaving their jobs to seek other employment has not risen in this period of tight labor markets.\nTo be sure, since last year, surveys have indicated that the proportion of workers fearful of layoff has stabilized and the number of voluntary job leavers has edged up. And, indeed, perhaps as a consequence, wage gains have accelerated some. But increases in the Employment Cost Index still trail behind what previous relationships to tight labor markets would have suggested, and a lingering sense of fear or uncertainty seems still to pervade the job market, though to a somewhat lesser extent.\nConsumer surveys do indicate greater optimism about the economy. However, it is one thing to believe that the economy, indeed the job market, will do well overall, but quite another to feel secure about one's individual situation, given the accelerated pace of corporate restructuring and the heightened fear of skill obsolescence that has apparently characterized this expansion. Persisting insecurity would help explain why measured personal saving rates have not declined as would have been expected from the huge increase in stock market wealth. We will, however, have a better fix on savings rates after the coming benchmark revisions to the national income and product accounts.\nThe combination in recent years of subdued compensation per hour and solid productivity advances has meant that unit labor costs of nonfinancial corporations have barely moved. Moreover, when you combine unit labor costs with nonlabor costs -- which account for one-quarter of total costs on a consolidated basis -- total unit costs for the year ended in the first quarter of 1997 rose only about half a percent. Hence, a significant part of the measured price increase over that period was attributable to a rise in profit margins, unusual well into a business expansion. Rising margins are further evidence suggesting that productivity gains have been unexpectedly strong; in these situations, real labor compensation usually catches up only with a lag.\nWhile accelerated technological change may well be an important element in unraveling the current economic puzzle, there have been other influences at play as well in restraining price increases at high levels of resource utilization. The strong dollar of the last two years has pared import prices and constrained the pricing behavior of domestic firms facing import competition. Increasing globalization has enabled greater specialization over a wider array of goods and services, in effect allowing comparative advantage to hold down costs and enhance efficiencies. Increased deregulation of telecommunications, motor and rail transport, utilities, and finance doubtless has been a factor restraining prices, as perhaps has the reduced market power of labor unions. Certainly, changes in the health care industry and the pricing of health services have greatly contributed to holding down growth in the cost of benefits, and hence overall labor compensation.\nMany of these forces are limited or temporary, and their effects can be expected to diminish, at which time cost and price pressures would tend to reemerge. The effects of an increased rate of technological change might be more persistent, but they too could not permanently hold down inflation if the Federal Reserve allows excess liquidity to flood financial markets. I have noted to you before the likelihood that at some point workers might no longer be willing to restrain wage gains for added security, at which time accelerating unit labor costs could begin to press on profit margins and prices, should monetary policy be too accommodative.\nWhen I discuss greater technological change, I am not referring primarily to a particular new invention. Instead, I have in mind the increasingly successful and pervasive application of recent technological advances, especially in telecommunications and computers, to enhance efficiencies in production processes throughout the economy. Many of these technologies have been around for some time. Why might they be having a more pronounced effect now?\nIn an intriguing paper prepared for a conference last year sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Professor Nathan Rosenberg of Stanford documented how, in the past, it often took a considerable period of time for the necessary synergies to develop between different forms of capital and technologies. One example is the invention of the dynamo in the mid 1800s. Rosenberg's colleague Professor Paul David had noted a number of years ago that it wasn't until the 1920s that critical complementary technologies of the dynamo -- for example, the electric motor as the primary source of mechanical drive in factories, and central generating stations -- were developed and in place and that production processes had fully adapted to these inventions.  \nWhat we may be observing in the current environment is a number of key technologies, some even mature, finally interacting to create significant new opportunities for value creation. For example, the applications for the laser were modest until the later development of fiber optics engendered a revolution in telecommunications. Broad advances in software have enabled us to capitalize on the prodigious gains in hardware capacity. The interaction of both of these has created the Internet. The accelerated synergies of the various technologies may be what have been creating the apparent significant new profit opportunities that presumably lie at the root of the recent boom in high-tech investment. An expected result of the widespread and effective application of information and other technologies would be a significant increase in productivity and reduction in business costs. We do not now know, nor do I suspect can anyone know, whether current developments are part of a once or twice in a century phenomenon that will carry productivity trends nationally and globally to a new higher track, or whether we are merely observing some unusual variations within the context of an otherwise generally conventional business cycle expansion. The recent improvement in productivity could be just transitory, an artifact of a temporary surge in demand and output growth. In view of the slowing in growth in the second quarter and the more moderate expansion widely expected going forward, data for profit margins on domestic operations and productivity from the second quarter on will be especially relevant in assessing whether recent improvements are structural or cyclical. Whatever the trend in productivity and, by extension, overall sustainable economic growth, from the Federal Reserve's point of view, the faster the better. We see our job as fostering the degree of liquidity that will best support the most effective platform for growth to flourish. We believe a noninflationary environment is such a platform because it promotes long-term planning and capital investment and keeps the pressure on businesses to contain costs and enhance efficiency. The Federal Reserve's policy problem is not with growth, but with maintaining an effective platform. To do so, we endeavor to prevent strains from developing in our economic system, which long experience tells us produce bottlenecks, shortages, and inefficiencies. These eventually create more inflation, which undermines economic expansion and limits the longer-term potential of the economy. In gauging the potential for oncoming strains, it is the effective capacity of the economy to produce that is important to us. An economy operating at a high level of utilization and growing 5 percent a year is in little difficulty if capacity is growing at least that fast. But a fully utilized economy growing at 1 percent will eventually get into trouble if capacity is growing less than that.  \nCapacity itself, however, is a complex concept, which requires a separate evaluation of its two components, capital and labor. It appears that capital, that is, plant and equipment, can adapt and expand more expeditiously than in the past to meet demands. Hence, capital capacity is now a considerably less rigid constraint than it once was. In recent years, technology has engendered a significant compression of lead times between order and delivery for production facilities. This has enabled output to respond increasingly faster to an upsurge in demand, thereby decreasing the incidence of strains on capital capacity and shortages so evident in earlier business expansions. Reflecting progressively shorter lead times for capital equipment, unfilled orders to shipment ratios for nondefense capital goods have declined by 30 percent in the last six years. Not only do producers have quicker access to equipment that embodies the most recent advances, but they have been able to adjust their overall capital stock more rapidly to increases in demand. The current lack of material shortages and bottlenecks, despite the high level and recent robust expansion of demand, is striking. The effective capacity of production facilities has increased substantially in recent years in response to strong final demands and the influence of cost reductions possible with the newer technologies. Increased flexibility is particularly evident in the computer, telecommunications, and related industries, a segment of our economy that seems far less subject to physical capacity constraints than many older-line establishments, and one that is assuming greater importance in our overall output. But the shortening of lags has been pervasive even in more mature industries, owing in part to the application of advanced technologies to production methods. At the extreme, if all capital goods could be produced at constant cost and on demand, the size of our nation's capital stock would never pose a restraint on production. We are obviously very far from that nirvana, but it is important to note that we are also far from the situation a half-century ago when our production processes were dominated by equipment such as open hearth steel furnaces, which had very exacting limits on how much they could produce in a fixed time frame and which required huge lead times to expand their capacity. Even so, today's economy as a whole still can face capacity constraints from its facilities. Indeed, just three years ago, bottlenecks in industrial production -- though less extensive than in years past at high levels of measured capacity utilization -- were nonetheless putting significant upward pressures on prices at earlier stages of production. More recently vendor performance has deteriorated somewhat, indicating that flexibility to meet demands still has limits. Although further strides toward greater facilities flexibility have occurred since 1994, this is clearly an evolutionary, not a revolutionary, process.  \nLabor Markets Moreover, technology and management changes have had only a limited effect on the ability of labor supply to respond to changes in demand. To be sure, individual firms have acquired additional flexibility by increased use of outsourcing and temporary workers. In addition, smaller work teams can adapt more readily to variations in order flows. While these techniques put the right workers at the right spots to reduce bottlenecks, they do not increase the aggregate supply of labor. That supply is sensitive to changes in demand, but to a far more limited extent than for facilities. New plants can almost always be built. But labor capacity for an individual country is constrained by the size of the working-age population, which, except for immigration, is basically determined several decades in the past. Of course, capital facilities and labor are not fully separate markets. Within limits, labor and capital are substitutes, and slack in one market can offset tightness in another. For example, additional work shifts can expand output without significant addition to facilities, and similarly more labor-displacing equipment can permit production to be increased with the same level of employment. Yet despite significant increases in capital equipment in recent years, new additions to labor supply have been inadequate to meet the demand for labor. As a consequence, the recent period has been one of significant reduction in labor market slack. Of the more than two million net new hires at an annual rate since early 1994, only about half have come from an expansion in the population aged 16 to 64 who wanted a job, and more than a third of those were net new immigrants. The remaining one million plus per year increase in employment has been pulled from those who had been reported as unemployed (600 thousand annually) and those who wanted, but had not actively sought, a job (more than 400 thousand annually). The latter, of course, are not in the official unemployment count. The key point is that continuously digging ever deeper into the available work age population is not a sustainable trajectory for job creation. The unemployment rate has a downside limit if for no other reason than unemployment, in part, reflects voluntary periods of job search and other frictional unemployment. There is also a limit on how many of the additional 5 million who wanted a job last quarter but were not actively seeking one could be readily absorbed into jobs -- in particular, the large number enrolled in school, and those who may lack the necessary skills or face other barriers to taking jobs. The rise in the average workweek since early 1996 suggests employers are having increasingly greater difficulty fitting the millions who want a job into available job slots. If the pace of job creation continues, the pressures on wages and other costs of hiring increasing numbers of such individuals could escalate more rapidly.  \nTo be sure, there remain an additional 34 million in the working-age population (age 16 - 64) who say they do not want a job. Presumably, some of these early retirees, students, or homemakers might be attracted to the job market if it became sufficiently rewarding. However, making it attractive enough could also involve upward pressures in real wages that would trigger renewed price pressures, undermining the expansion. Thus, there would seem to be emerging constraints on potential labor input. Even before we reach the ultimate limit of sustainable labor supply growth, the economy's ability to expand employment at the recent rate should rapidly diminish. The availability of unemployed labor could no longer add to growth, irrespective of the degree of slack in physical facilities at that time. Simply adding new facilities will not increase production unless output per worker improves. Such improvements are possible if worker skills increase, but such gains come slowly through improved education and on-the-job training. They are also possible as capital substitutes for labor, but are limited by the state of technology. More significant advances require technological breakthroughs. At the cutting edge of technology, where America finds itself, major improvements cannot be produced on demand. New ideas that matter are hard won. The Economic Outlook As I noted, the recent performance of the labor markets suggests that the economy was on an unsustainable track. Unless aggregate demand increases more slowly than it has in recent years -- more in line with trends in the supply of labor and productivity -- imbalances will emerge. We do not know, however, at what point pressures would develop -- or indeed whether the economy is already close to that point. Fortunately, the very rapid growth of demand over the winter has eased recently. To an extent this easing seems to reflect some falloff in growth of demand for consumer durables and for inventories to a pace more in line with moderate expansion in income. But some of the recent slower growth could simply be a product of abnormal weather patterns, which contributed to a first-quarter surge in output and weakened the second quarter, in which case the underlying trend could be somewhat higher than suggested by the second-quarter data alone. Certainly, business and consumer confidence remains high and financial conditions are supportive of growth. Particularly notable is the run-up in stock market wealth, the full effects of which apparently have not been reflected in overall demand, but might yet be.  \nMonetary policymakers, balancing these various forces, forecast a continuation of less rapid growth in coming quarters. For 1997 as a whole, the central tendency of their forecasts has real GDP growing 3 to 3-1\/4 percent. This would be much more brisk than was anticipated in February, and the upward revision to this estimate largely reflects the unexpectedly strong first quarter. The central tendency of monetary policymakers' projections is that real GDP will expand 2 to 2-1\/2 percent in 1998. This pace of expansion is expected to keep the unemployment rate close to its current low level. We are reasonably confident that inflation will be quite modest for 1997 as a whole. The central tendency of the forecasts is that consumer prices will rise only 2-1\/4 to 2-1\/2 percent this year. This would be a significantly better outcome than the 2-3\/4 to 3 percent CPI inflation foreseen in February. Federal Open Market Committee members do see higher rates of inflation next year. The central tendency of the projections is that CPI inflation will be 2-1\/2 to 3 percent in 1998 -- a little above the expectation for this year. However, much of this increase is presumed to result from the absence of temporary factors that are holding down inflation this year. In particular, the favorable movements in food and energy prices of 1997 are unlikely to be repeated, and non-oil import prices may not continue to decline. While it is possible that better productivity trends and subdued wage growth will continue to help damp the increases in business costs associated with tight labor markets, this is a situation that the Federal Reserve plans to monitor closely. I have no doubt that the current stance of policy -- characterized by a nominal federal funds rate around 5-1\/2 percent -- will need to be changed at some point to foster sustainable growth and low inflation. Adjustments in the policy instrument in response to new information are a necessary and, I should like to emphasize, routine aspect of responsible policymaking. For the present, as I indicated, demand growth does appear to have moderated, but whether that moderation will be sufficient to avoid putting additional pressures on resources is an open question. With considerable momentum behind the expansion and labor market utilization rates unusually high, the Federal Reserve must be alert to the possibility that additional action might be called for to forestall excessive credit creation. The Federal Reserve is intent on gearing its policy to facilitate the maximum sustainable growth of the economy, but it is not, as some commentators have suggested, involved in an experiment that deliberately prods the economy to see how far and fast it can grow. The costs of a failed experiment would be much too burdensome for too many of our citizens.  \nClearly, in considering issues of monetary policy we need to distinguish carefully between sustainable economic growth and unsustainable accelerations of activity. Sustainable growth reflects the increased capacity of the economic system to produce goods and services over the longer run. It is largely the sum of increases in productivity and in the labor force. That growth contrasts with a second type, a more transitory growth. An economy producing near capacity can expand faster for a short time, often through unsustainably low short-term interest rates and excess credit creation. But this is not growth that promotes lasting increases in standards of living and in jobs for our nation. Rather, it is a growth that creates instability and thereby inhibits the achievement of our nation's economic goals. The key question is how monetary policy can best foster the highest rate of sustainable growth and avoid amplifying swings in output, employment, and prices. The historical evidence is unambiguous that excessive creation of credit and liquidity contributes nothing to the long-run growth of our productive potential and much to costly shorter-term fluctuations. Moreover, it promotes inflation, impairing the economy's longer-term potential output. Our objective has never been to contain inflation as an end in itself, but rather as a precondition for the highest possible long-run growth of output and income -- the ultimate goal of macroeconomic policy. In considering possible adjustments of policy to achieve that goal, the issue of lags in the effects of monetary policy is crucial. The evidence clearly demonstrates that monetary policy affects the financial markets immediately but works with significant lags on output, employment, and prices. Thus, as I pointed out earlier, policy needs to be made today on the basis of likely economic conditions in the future. As a consequence, and in the absence of once-reliable monetary guides to policy, there is no alternative to formulating policy using risk-reward tradeoffs based on what are, unavoidably, uncertain forecasts. Operating on uncertain forecasts, of course, is not unusual. People do it every day, consciously or subconsciously. A driver might tap the brakes to make sure not to be hit by a truck coming down the street, even if he thinks the chances of such an event are relatively low; the costs of being wrong are simply too high. Similarly, in conducting monetary policy the Federal Reserve needs constantly to look down the road to gauge the future risks to the economy and act accordingly.  \nGrowth of Money and Credit The view that the Federal Reserve's best contribution to growth is to foster price stability has informed both our tactical decisions on the stance of monetary policy and our longer-run judgments on appropriate rates of liquidity provision. To be sure, growth rates of monetary and credit aggregates have become less reliable as guides for monetary policy as a result of rapid change in our financial system. As I have reported to you previously, the current uncertainties regarding the behavior of the monetary aggregates have implied that we have been unable to employ them as guides to short-run policy decisions. Accordingly, in recent years we have reported annual ranges for money growth that serve as benchmarks under conditions of price stability and a return to historically stable patterns of velocity. Over the past several years, the monetary aggregates -- M2 in particular -- have shown some signs of reestablishing such stable patterns. The velocity of M2 has fluctuated in a relatively narrow range, and some of its variation within that range has been explained by interest rate movements, in a relationship similar to that established over earlier decades. We find this an encouraging development, and it is possible that at some point the FOMC might elect to put more weight on such monetary quantities in the conduct of policy. But in our view, sufficient evidence has not yet accumulated to support such a judgment. Consequently, we have decided to keep the existing ranges of growth for money and credit for 1997 and carry them over to next year, retaining the in\nterpretation of the money ranges as benchmarks for the achievement of price stability. With nominal income growth strong relative to the rate that would likely prevail under conditions of price stability, the growth of M2 is likely to run in the upper part of its range both this year and next, while M3 could run a little above its cone. Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is likely to remain well within its range, with private debt growth brisk and federal debt growth subdued. Although any tendency for the aggregates to exceed their ranges would not, in the event, necessarily call for an examination of whether a policy adjustment was needed, the Federal Reserve will be closely examining financial market prices and flows in the context of a broad range of economic and price indicators for evidence that the sustainability of the economic expansion may be in jeopardy. Concluding Comment The Federal Reserve recognizes, of course, that monetary policy does not determine the economy's potential. All that it can do is help establish sound money and a stable financial environment in which the inherent vitality of a market economy can flourish and promote the capital investment that in the long run is the basis for vigorous economic growth. Similarly, other government policies also have a major role to play in contributing to economic growth. A continued emphasis on market mechanisms through deregulation will help sharpen incentives to work, save, invest, and innovate. Similarly, a fiscal policy oriented toward limited growth in government expenditures, producing smaller budget deficits and even budget surpluses, would tend to lower real interest rates even further, also promoting capital investment. The recent experience provides striking evidence of the potential for the continuation and extension of monetary, fiscal, and structural policies to enhance our economy's performance in the period ahead.\n","classes":[46,70],"classes_pad":null}

Diane Feinstein, another California Democrat, last year succeeded in thwarting a Ward Valley land transfer proposal, even though it had a Democratic co-sponsor. This year's Ward Valley bill, reintroduced by Republican Sen. Frank Murkowski of Alaska, has no Democratic sponsor.\nThe dump is licensed to handle waste that includes contaminated clothing and equipment from hospitals and labs that use nuclear material, and nuclear power plant components excluding spent nuclear fuel.\nPower plant components are expected to make up the largest share of the waste, according to a Congressional Research Service report released last week. When the state studied the Mojave site it expected a bigger share of the waste to come from labs and hospitals.\nWard Valley opponents say the state should be more cautious now that the picture has changed, because the power plant components have much longer-lived radioactive material than the gloves, gowns and test tubes from labs and hospitals.\nBut California Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, argues there is no need to delay the land transfer because the state has met all of its own requirements for approving the site.\nIn a report last week, Congress's independent General Accounting Office affirmed the view that the state had already considered most of the issues that the Interior Department wanted to study before transferring the land.\n\"The GAO says that additional delays are not needed,\" Murkowski said, adding that the public was more at risk by keeping radioactive waste on site at hospitals, labs and nuclear plants than by transferring it to the desert.\nBut GAO acting associate director Gary Jones said the Interior Department wanted to be extra careful because the California dump was a test case for U.S. policy on making states responsible for disposing of low-level radioactive waste. No other state has built a new dump yet.\n","classes":[90,97,104],"classes_pad":null}

{"codes":["C13","CCAT"],"headline":"FCC issues key order preempting curbs on TV dishes.","text":"\nIn a precedent-setting decision, U.S. regulators Tuesday said federal rules bar a small Kansas town from slapping restrictions on where consumers can install satellite television dishes.\nIt is the first time the Federal Communications Commission has pre-empted a local ordinance under new rules that prevent localities from placing curbs on the placement of small dishes as well as antennas for receiving wireless cable TV.\nThe ruling signals that the agency will not let local officials around the nation impose what it considers to be unreasonable site restrictions. The decision is a victory for satellite TV companies and similar competitors to traditional cable TV.\nThe FCC rules, adopted last August, generally bar local governments and homeowner associations from setting restrictions on dishes of up to 1 meter in diameter, except in cases involving public safety or historic preservation.\nThey stem from last year's communications act, which gives the FCC the power to pre-empt local curbs that might interfere with implementation of the landmark 1996 law. FCC pre-emption decisions in other areas of the law are due out soon.\nThe FCC said its antenna-placement rules prohibit Meade, Kan., from requiring installers and users of satellite dishes to get a $5 permit prior to installation and before local officials approve placement.\nAgency officials also said the ordinance's \"property setback regulations\" were not spelled out, resulting in delays in installation, maintenance and use.\nThe FCC said a proposed fine of $500 a day for violators held up installation and was unjustified.\n\"This order strikes a blow for competition and for the consumer,\" Meredith Jones, head of the FCC's cable bureau, said of the agency's ruling.\n\"If we cannot prevent unreasonable restrictions on the use of satellite dishes and other receiving antennas, competition in the market for the delivery of multichannel video will be stifled.\"\nMeade, with a population of a little more than 1,500, is roughly 160 miles southwest of Wichita. A lawyer representing Meade did not return phone calls.\nLocal governments have sought to impose curbs on antenna placment to prevent their communities from being littered with unsightly dishes.\nThe FCC has given local officials leeway in cases that revolve around public safety or historic preservation. For example, localities can restrict the placement of dishes and antennas on fire escapes.\nBut consumers complain they do not want their reception hampered. And satellite TV broadcasters and others that compete with traditional cable TV reject curbs that make it more difficult for them to offer services.\n\"Now consumers are free to go out and buy satellite systems without having to worry about restrictions that have nothing to do with the systems,\" said Andy Paul, senior vice president of the Satellite Broadcasting and Communications Association, a trade group which asked the FCC to pre-empt the Meade ordinance.\nThe association and a satellite retailer in Meade had told the FCC that the firm and its customers were threatened with fines and the shutoff of their electricity if the fines were not paid.\nThey said Meade's city administrator had told at least seven of the firm's 13 customers that their dish installation did not comply with the town ordinance -- even though these customers had received permits from the town.\n","classes":[13,44],"classes_pad":null}

He spent much of the time looking at the members of the jury and at one point smoothed down his hair.\nThe defence began its summation on Tuesday.\nThe prosecution said the evidence proved Gigante heads the Genovese crime family, was responsible for the murders, helped control a lucrative window-replacement scheme and tried to kill John Gotti, boss of the rival Gambino crime family and another mobster, Peter Savino.\nAmong the informants to testify against Gigante was Salvatore \"Sammy the Bull\" Gravano, a mob turncoat whose testimony was key in the 1992 murder and racketeering conviction of Gambino godfather Gotti. Gotti is serving a life prison term without possibility of parole.\nWeissmann sought to puncture the defence's main point that Anthony \"Fat Tony\" Salerno was convicted of being the Genovese crime family boss in 1986.

It's a good first step. It won't solve the Middle East peace problems, not by a long shot,\" he said.\nStill, he said the United States was in close coordination with the EU negotiator and supported his efforts to arrange the meeting.\nOn Naveh's charge that Palestinians engaged in terrorism against Israel, Burns rejected any hint that \"the entire Palestinian Authority is full of people who want to promote terrorism.\"\nHe said Arafat \"unequivocally\" objected to any association by Palestinian Authority members in any effort to destabilise or plan terrorist attacks against Israel.\nAnd he noted that Arafat had over the weekend arrested four Palestinian Authority officials who are suspected of involvement in plots against Israel.\nHe drew a distinction between Arafat and his former justice minister, Freih Abu Meddein, who angered the United States and rights groups by campaigning to execute Palestinans who sell land to the Israelis.\nOn Monday, Burns said Washington would \"shed no tears\" for Abu Meddein, who then accused Burns of acting like a rude cowboy with a Zionist attitude.\nOn Tuesday, Burns replied: \"Well, I'm proud to be called a vulgar cowboy with a Zionist attitude if, in fact, he's upset with me for calling him someone who has been irresponsible in public office and who doesn't deserve to hold public office.\"\n\"We're very pleased he's resigned ... because here's someone who tried to pour oil on the flames and incite violence against Israelis.\"\nNetanyahu said on Monday he was sending Naveh, a senior adviser, to Washington with proposals for ending the four-month-old peacemaking crisis. This follows a trip to Washington last week by Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.\nIsraeli-PLO talks, launched with a U.S.-backed interim accord in 1993, have been stuck since Netanyahu started building a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem in March, triggering Palestinian protests.\nOn the deadlock, Burns said the United States would never give up its mediation efforts but Palestinians and Israel have prime responsibility to revive peace negotiations.\nHe gave no indication that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright -- who has not visited the Middle East since taking office in January -- would go there ahead of a planned economic summit in Qatar in November.\nAt the moment, Albright is \"fully involved, both in the strategy and tactics (of U.S. peace efforts).

Excluding the Conrail impact, CSX second-quarter earnings would have totalled a record $245 million, the company said.\nCSX said cost-control efforts helped boost the company's operating income to a quarterly record of $433 million, up from $408 million in last year's second quarter.\nRevenues totalled $2.7 billion for the period, virtually unchanged from a year ago.\nIn addition to its railroad operations, CSX owns Sea-Land Service, the biggest U.S. container shipping company.\nCSX rose $1.56 to $57.375 a share in consolidated afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\nBurlington Northern Sante Fe said its net income rose 11 percent for the second quarter, driven by solid growth in its intermodal business: cargo carried in containers hauled by ships, trucks and trains.\nThe nation's second biggest freight railroad reported profits of $235 million, or $1.50 a share, for the period, compared with $211 million, or $1.35 a share, a year ago.\nBurlington, based in Forth Worth, Texas, said revenues totalled $2.07 billion for the second quarter, up $49 million from the second quarter of 1996.\n\"The company has rebounded well from the weather-related difficulties of the first quarter,\" said Burlington Chairman Robert Krebs. \"We expect our results to continue to improve throughout the balance of 1997.\"\nIntermodal revenues climbed 12 percent during the quarter, to $563 million, the company said.\nBurlington said agricultural commodity revenues declined by 10 percent to $239 milion, reflecting a poor Southern Plains wheat crop and fewer corn shipments. Coal revenues were also lower, declining 2 percent to $482 million.\nBurlington Northern Sante Fe's rail network covers some 35,000 miles in the western United States and Canada.\nThe company's stock rose $1.94 to $93.50 in consolidated NYSE trading at midday.\n","classes":[15,16,25,26,44],"classes_pad":null}

A key tenet of the Constitution is the separation of church and state.\nThose against the amendment say the state should not meddle in religion and that prayer in schools would be an insult to parents and children from diverse backgrounds.\n\"This would disrupt the religious peace we have enjoyed for years,\" said Representative Robert Scott, a Virginia Democrat on the committee, adding that religious freedoms were guaranteed under the Constitution and did not need to be amended.\nTuesday's hearing coincided with the release of a report by the U.S. State Department on religious freedoms worldwide. The report stressed that religious liberty was central to American history and identity.\nA host of court cases has been filed challenging religious issues ranging from nativity scenes in courthouses to banning religious references at school graduations.\n\"This (amendment) represents a consensus by those who share the public's belief that our courts have too often become hostile to religion, placing barriers to religious expression which do not exist for other forms of free speech,\" Istook told the hearing.\nSimilar Constitutional amendments have been discussed at committee levels before, and in 1971 the House rejected such a change. The Senate has held votes on it three times since 1966, but none of those bids succeeded.\nIt could be years before the proposal is voted on. After Tuesday's hearing the amendment may be considered by a full committee which must decide whether to send it to the House.\nAmerican Atheists Inc., a watchdog group for the separation of the church and state, said in written testimony to the hearing that the amendment would allow \"special privileges\" for religion.\n\"Not only is the zero-God world of Atheists ruled out by this clause, the multi-God world of polytheists is ruled out as well,\" said Ellen Johnson, president of the Atheist group.\nSeveral congressmen said stipulating that prayers should be allowed at schools could open the door to such practices as animal sacrifice, which is a ritual in some religions.\n\"If we are to have equal access to all religions then the Satanic cults would have to be allowed,\" said Chet Edwards, a Texan Democrat.\nRev. Timothy McDonald of the Iconium Baptist Church told the hearing that cults, satanists and some white supremacist groups would be granted the right to enforce prayer on children under the amendment. \"Instead of religion helping bring us together, religious conflict would drive us apart.\"\n","classes":[90,104,106],"classes_pad":null}

{"codes":["C13","CCAT"],"headline":"FDIC proposes less capital charge on service asset.","text":"\nU.S. banks could hold substantially more mortgage servicing rights without a charge reducing their regulatory capital under a proposed rule released on Tuesday by federal bank regulators.\nUnder the proposal, the combined value of a bank's mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships could equal up to 100 percent of tier 1 capital without incurring a charge.\nAs banks have increasingly securitized and sold mortgage loans, a significant market has developed for mortgage servicing rights, the fees from administering the loans.  \nFor many years, banks that sold loans but retained the lucrative servicing fees did not record the right to collect the stream of fees as an asset on their books. But banks that purchased identical servicing rights in the secondary market were required to record such rights as intangible assets.\nOver the past two years, however, new accounting standards have required banks to record both types of servicing rights as intangible assets. And bank regulators generally deduct intangible assets, like goodwill, from a bank's tier 1 capital since those assets may be difficult to sell if the bank runs into trouble or is seized by the government.  \nBut with a highly developed and liquid market for mortgage servicing rights, regulators decided that, up to a certain level, mortgage servicing rights should not be deducted from capital, according Robert Storch, chief of the accounting section in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp's Division of Supervision.\nThe rights are \"a liquid enough asset that we could include some reasonable amount in capital,\" Storch told reporters after an FDIC board meeting to discuss the proposal.  \nPurchased credit card relationships, the value of marketing other products to credit card holders, would still be subject to a separate limit of 25 percent of tier 1 capital.\nBoth types of assets would also be subject to a 10 percent \"haircut,\" meaning the assets would be valued for regulatory purposes at the lower of book value or 90 percent of fair market value.\nComptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig backed the haircut as an appropriate and \"prudent\" treatment given the volatility in prices of servicing assets.  \nServicing rights on credit cards and any other types of loans would continue to be treated as intangible assets, and fully deducted from capital, under the proposal.\nRegulators asked for comments, due within 60 days, on whether servicing rights on other types of loans should receive special treatment. Regulators also asked for comments on the capital treatment of interest-only strips not in the form of securities.\nAs of the end of the of the first quarter, only one bank has run up against the old mortgage servicing asset limit of 50 percent, and a few more institutions hold between 25 and 50 percent, Storch said.\nRegulators anticipate that many more banks will approach or exceed the 50 percent limit over the next few years as a result of the new accounting rules, he added.\n--Aaron Pressman((202-898-8312))\n","classes":[13,44],"classes_pad":null}

The rest of it is a so what statement about their earnings and no one seriously believes they can generate better value than UPR's bid at least in the short term,\" said one analyst who declined to be named.\nDespite the high level of acceptances, Union Pacific still has to talk to Pennzoil's board if it wants to win the company.\nThe company can tie up the bid in the courts for years and has a whole range of anti-takeover measures and a poison-pill defence.\n\"Pennzoil is very concerned about the structure of the deal, the best way to eliminate that is to negotiate terms,\" said Young.

I have accepted it and I have urged them to go to work immediately with the Congress to try to reach an acceptable resolution of this,\" Clinton said.\nHe said the two officials deserved credit for the \"exhaustive analysis that they applied to this problem,\" and he added that administration officials were \"going to try to work with Congress to achieve a resolution.\"\nControversy over the issue has emerged in recent years due to the tougher sentences given mainly to blacks for crack cocaine while the punishment has been lighter for convictions involving powder cocaine, a drug more often used by whites.\nThe disparity has led to claims of unfairness and inconsistency in the nation's judicial system.\nUnder the Clinton proposal, sellers of 25 grams of crack cocaine would receive the same mandatory prison sentence as someone convicted of selling 250 grams of powdered cocaine.\nUnder current law, five grams of crack cocaine and 500 grams of powder cocaine both trigger the same mandatory minimum sentence -- five years in prison.\nThe new proposal stemmed from a recommendation by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, an independent agency in the judicial branch of government, in late April to narrow the differences in punishment for the two types of cocaine.\nIt urged that the five-year sentence should be reduced for powder cocaine to a level between 125 and 375 grams while the trigger for crack cocaine should be raised to 25 to 75 grams.\nClinton then ordered Reno and McCaffrey, a retired Army general, to review the recommendations and report back to him, which they did earlier this month.\nCongress asked the commission to submit new recommendations after rejecting proposed changes the panel made in 1995 to sharply reduce the penalties for crack cocaine.\nThe latest proposal still must be approved by Congress and signed into law by Clinton.\n","classes":[90,91,104],"classes_pad":null}

Investigators believe he is in south Florida. Police said Cunanan, descibed as a master of disguise, may be dressing as a woman to avoid capture.\nThe victims in the murders reportedly carried out with the same gun were David Madson, a Minnesota architect, and William Reese, a gravedigger in New Jersey. The two other killings in which Cunanan is the suspect were committed with a claw hammer and a gardening tool.\nThe FBI meanwhile said it had no evidence suggesting Cunanan ever visited Versace's Miami home.\nSome reports have said the FBI had photographic evidence placing Cunanan at Versace's house prior to the murder.\nThe relationship, if any existed at all, between the two men is not known. But Vanity Fair magazine, which was preparing a profile on Cunanan before Versace's killing, said they were casually acquainted.\n","classes":[90,91,105],"classes_pad":null}

[CORRECTED 16:55 GMT]","text":"\nThe dollar powered to another 71-month high versus the mark but faltered against the yen as cross-trading dominated activity ahead of a key speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, dealers said.\nMark\/yen drew much of the focus, extending its slide to over a yen from last night's highs (corrects from lows). Speculators reportedly went short the yen overnight only to pay a heavy price as the Japanese unit roared higher, traders said.\n\"Some very big positions were put on against the yen and those guys are sucking wind right now,\" said one trader at a U.S. bank.  \nDollar\/mark's surprising overnight rally caught a second wind by late morning as shorts threw in the towel and stops were triggered as the greenback neared 1.82, dealers said.\n\"Dollar\/mark has a chance to trade higher, but it seems like the New York market walked in and was a little bit stunned by the overnight ranges, said John Beerling, chief dealer at Norwest Bank.\nThe dollar at midday stood at 1.8168\/78 marks, up from 1.8130\/40 at the open and 1.7960\/70 at Monday's close. Just before noon the greenback peaked at 1.8197. Dollar\/yen fell to 115.50\/55 from 116.00\/10.  \nMark\/yen stood near 63.50, off from an overnight peak at 64.70. Dealers cited continuing flight to the yen from southeast Asian players in the wake of recent heavy selling of exotic Asian currencies.\n\"The Japanese came back from holiday and the Philippine peso was under pressure again today. The yen is like the pound in Europe, it gets a lot of support in times of stress,\" said Mike Malpede, senior foreign exchange analyst at Refco Group.\nThe yen also gained on the Australian dollar and sterling, dealers said. Meanwhile a knock-out option at dollar\/yen 116.50 expired during U.S. morning, bringing fresh yen buying.  \n\"At this level, there are a lot of people looking to sell dollar\/yen. It got a little too long yesterday,\" said a trader at an Australian bank in New York.\nBut dollar\/mark continued to find ample buyers following the latest official indications that Europe's proposed single currency will be softer than the mark, dealers said.\nBundesbank council member Hans-Juergen Koebnick got most of the attention, telling German radio the euro could be stable even if Germany posts a deficit of 3.2 percent of GDP and France of 3.3 percent.  \nThe tacit acknowledgement that the EU will allow nations to violate the 3.0-percent budget deficit-to-GDP ratio continues to hammer the mark, dealers said.\n\"We are seeing a quiet acquiescence to a deutschemark devaluation,\" said Malpede. \"As long as they don't have notable imported inflation, the Germans will continue to try to compete (in global markets) with a weaker deutschemark.\"\nYet other players remained on the alert for signs of Bundesbank intervention, claiming the central bank's leaders would act to stop the dollar's advance if they believed they could.  \n\"People are viewing the Bundesbank's silence as a commitment to a higher dollar, a weak euro and a weak mark. But that's not necessarily true,\" said the U.S. bank trader.\n\"The only way they could fight the trend is with higher interest rates or faster (German) growth and on both of which they have no flexibility right now,\" she added.\nIn other trade, the dollar slipped to 1.4810\/20 Swiss francs from 1.4852\/62. Sterling fell to $1.6730\/40 from $1.6760\/70. The dollar rose to Canadian $1.3814\/19 from C$1.3796\/01.\n((--Chris Stetkiewicz, 212-859-1664))\n","classes":[116,118,123],"classes_pad":null}

It looked specifically at treatment of believers in 78 countries.\nIn an introduction, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said religious liberty was \"central to American history and identity\" and its promotion was \"a fundamental source of our strength in the world... We simply could not lead without it.\"\nShe said the State Department had asked U.S. embassies to provide more reporting on religious issues, given them more coverage in its annual human rights report and taken more account of religious persecution in assessing asylum requests.\nThe report was compiled in response to a demand by Congress incorporated in an appropriations act for the current fiscal year. Originally requested for January, it was delayed to gather more information.\nIn an apparent attempt to head off criticism of the report's focus on Christians, the State Department said in a fact sheet that this was specified by Congress.\n\"Of course, U.S. policy -- and our actions around the world -- support religious freedom globally and apply equally to all religions and beliefs,\" it said.\nIn its section on China, the report said that the Chinese constitution stated that citizens \"enjoy freedom of religious belief\".\n\"Nonetheless, the Government of China has sought to restrict all actual religious practice to government-authorised religious organisations and registered places of worship,\" the State Department said.\nIt said that in accordance with a central policy directive Chinese authorities in some areas made strong efforts to crack down on unregistered Catholic and Protestant movements in 1996 and 1997.\nThe report said the United States had made freedom of religion a major focus of its human rights policy towards China and President Bill Clinton and other leaders had raised the issue frequently in talks with Chinese officials.\nDiscussing Russia, the report said the new legislation, passed by parliament but not yet signed into law by President Boris Yeltsin, would restrict the activities of foreign missionaries and new or minority confessions or sects.\nClinton had expressed concern to Yeltsin last month over the law and other administration officials had raised it with Russian counterparts, it said.\n","classes":[90,93,106],"classes_pad":null}

Kansas Republican Pat Roberts said Browner's assurances did not have legal force, and that states could target farm areas for enforcement even if the EPA advised them against it.\nThe American Farm Bureau Federation in a statement also worried that the EPA rule \"will only serve to put American agriculture at a competitive disadvantage with other countries and put agricultural producers out of work.\"\nBrowner also tried to assure the Senate panel that the agency realized prescribed burning on federal and farm lands was a useful tool, and will work with the Agriculture Department's Forest Service and the Natural Resource Conservation Service on air quality plans to accomodate that.\nThe EPA also will work with an Agriculture Department task force and the Senate committee on the farm-related clean air issues, she said.\n","classes":[13,44,90,97],"classes_pad":null}

{"codes":["GCAT","GPOL"],"headline":"Republican turmoil may cost them in next election.","text":"\nBy Alan Elsner, U.S. Political Correspondent\nRepublicans, in turmoil after last week's failed attempt to depose House Speaker Newt Gingrich, are beginning to wonder if their internal disarray could hurt them in next year's mid-term elections.\nUnder normal circumstances, Republicans should anticipate a banner year in 1998. The party holding the White House has lost seats in every mid-term with the sole exception of 1934 and losses are particularly heavy, averaging some 40 House seats, in the sixth year of a presidency.\nHowever, some Republican lawmakers and commentators are so worried about the fighting within their party they are predicting far smaller gains next year, or worse.\n\"Off-year elections are about turnout. If Republican voters out there are kind of disillusioned ... turnout could drop by 2 or 3 percent. That's all it would take,\" said Bill Kristol, the Republican editor of the conservative Weekly Standard magazine.\n\"Democrats could retake the House. I don't think that's out of the question,\" he said.\nRepublicans enjoy a narrow 12-seat majority in the 435-member House of Representatives. But 21 of their members won election in 1996 with less than 51 percent of the vote and are obviously vulnerable.\nRepublican control of the Senate in 1998 is not seen as being under threat and the party could even widen its 55-45 majority because several Democrats in Republican-leaning states are retiring.\nFear of the election was part of the reason for the revolt against Gingrich, who remains highly unpopular in the nation. Conservatives, who are the heart of the uprising, are frustrated at the effortless way President Bill Clinton seems able to outmanoeuvre their leadership time and again.\nThe collapse of the revolt solved neither of these problems and merely intensified distrust and intrigue permeating the party, which seems set for more of internal strife in the months ahead.\nGingrich seems traumatized by his strategic defeat at Clinton's hands in 1995, when Republicans were blamed for shutting down the federal government.\nHe was further weakened earlier this year when he was reprimanded and fined by the House for ethical violations. Now, he finds himself squeezed between the president on one side and his own members on the other in crucial budget and tax negotiations with the White House.\n\"Republicans have lost the public relations battle. They have been unable to craft a message and compete politically with Clinton, who has seized the political centre,\" said American University political scientist Allan Lichtman.\n\"Clinton is suddenly the champion of the middle class and Republicans are defenders of the rich. They might as well paint their Achilles heel with fluorescent paint,\" he said.\nWith Gingrich running scared, Republicans looked to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and their new party chairman Jim Nicholson to fill the leadership void. Both have disappointed.\nLott has been unwilling or unable to become a high profile public spokesman while Nicholson has remained a gray, anonymous figure, unknown to the country at large.\n\"I don't think we have a leader right now,\" said Tony Blankley, Gingrich's former spokesman.\nTensions between Republicans who stress economic issues and those for whom social questions are uppermost have grown, as demonstrated by the refusal of Senate Foreign Relations chairman Jesse Helms to allow Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, a fellow Republican, to become U.S. ambassador to Mexico.\nFor all the bad news, the good news for Republicans is that the 1998 elections remain 15 months away -- an eternity in politics.\n\"Ninety-nine percent of the American people do not care about 99 percent of the news that comes from Washington about all this intrigue,\" said New York Representative Bill Paxon, who was forced to resign his position in the Republican House leadership following the coup attempt.\nBut Paxon conceded his party still had a problem.\n\"We are not communicating the great work of our members, and we're not doing it in an effective way,\" he said.\n","classes":[90,104],"classes_pad":null}

A foreign ministry spokesman in Beijing called it a \"reckless trampling of the U.N.

That discussion -- held in Malta on the fringe of another EU meeting -- was marked by terse exchanges and there was no formal joint public appearance.\nTuesday's meeting appeared far more cordial as Arafat and Levy shared a podium with Poos at a news conference.\n\"I am highly satisfied with our discussions,\" Levy said. \"I am sure we are now going to be able to establish the confidence necessary to proceed.\"\nArafat agreed. \"Significant and positive steps have been taken,\" he said. \"We have to continue these meetings, especially as the peace process is facing serious problems.\"\nArafat referred to Levy as \"our cousin\", adding: \"I am firmly convinced that he sets great store by the peace process.\"\nLevy said: \"I am very satisfied with what I heard in the message from President Arafat.\"\nThe meeting, which lasted nearly an hour, was the highest-level contact between Israel and the Palestinians since April.\n\"The whole system is no longer blocked,\" Poos said. \"The atmosphere was excellent... We discussed ways in which the two parties might restart a dialogue.\"\nNeither Arafat or Levy would elaborate on what had been decided, but both said the meeting was a breakthrough.\nPoos later said they had agreed to resume work on the minor committees, a point he described as significant.\nLevy earlier gave a spirited defence of Israel's commitment to Middle East peace as he addressed members of the European Parliament's foreign affairs committee in a mixture of French and Hebrew.\n\"We see peace as a value and a goal, but it is a complicated issue,\" he said. \"I know that some of you feel Israel is not helping the peace process, but this is not us being stubborn, this is us defending out lives.\"\nLevy was given a hostile reception, but retorted to  one heckler: \"You have to be in Israel or with Israel to understand completely.\"\n","classes":[80,88,90,93,104],"classes_pad":null}

Were Boeing to go ahead with the merger regardless, it could impose fines up to 10 percent of the companies' turnover.\nSome European antitrust lawyers had speculated that the Commission could rule the merger illegal in its present form, leaving the door open for Boeing to refile a modified agreement at a later stage.\n","classes":[13,25,26,40,44,80,87,90,93],"classes_pad":null}

If it lines up enough allies in the group to form a 25 percent block, it could stop the 24 billion pound merger announced in May.\nThe Guinness and GrandMet chairmen, who have met twice recently with LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault, were expected to reply to his proposal to set up a listed company blending their respective drinks activities as early as Wednesday after a Guinness board meeting.\nArnault quit the Guinness board to show his discontent with the management's lack of support for his plan.\nLVMH declined to comment on reports that Arnault was travelling to Britain this week to try to convince holders of Guinness's and GrandMet's dispersed capital that his plan would generate more value than the creation of a sprawling drinks, beer, canned goods and fast foods conglomerate.\nArnault's plan would establish a drinks group with more than 60 billion francs ($9.9 billion) in sales and a portfolio ranging from Hennessy cognacs and Moet Chandon champagnes to GrandMet's Smirnoff, Gilbey's, J&B and Bailey's brands and Guinness's Johnnie Walker, Dewar's, Gordon and Tanqueray drinks.\nHe proposes to put LVMH's 66 percent stake in Moet Hennessy, its 14.2 percent stake in Guinness and newly acquired 6.4 percent holding in GrandMet into the new drinks company whose market capitalisation is estimated at roughly 70 billion francs.\nArnault signalled this week that he was flexible on one of the potential sticking points -- his stake in the new drinks company.\nLVMH initially floated the prospect of a 35 percent stake but now says that, depending on the valuations, it may take less.\n\"LVMH said it would have 35 percent of the new drinks company, Guinness said LVMH's holdings would give it only 25 percent, and it will end up being around 30 percent,\" said a Paris-based analyst.\n\"I think he'll further refine his offer. He might reduce it to 30 percent. My feeling is that we'll see a spirits company floated. I believe that will happen,\" said an analyst in London.\n\"I think he has leverage with shareholders in both companies. There are two things he has to do -- show that there are tangible synergies, which there are, and come up with a reasonable price for Moet Hennessy which he is in the process of doing. If the price is reasonable, shareholders will line up with Arnault,\" the analyst said.\nArnault opposes the GrandMet-Guinness merger which risked marginalising LVMH's drinks business and locking up part of its capital in an unlisted subsidiary of the new GMG Brands.\nLast month LVMH spent more than eight billion francs to buy 6.4 percent of Grand Met, becoming its largest shareholder as well as the leading shareholder in Guinness.\nThe French company previously launched legal action against Guinness to claim the right to buy it out of the valuable distribution ventures they share if it merged with GrandMet. Those ventures hold the rights for 10 years to market Guinness brands in France, the United States and much of the Far East.\nGuinness shares fell 11 pence to 598, and Grand Met stock rose 15-1\/2 pence to 630 on Tuesday.\nLVMH's stock fell 0.32 percent to 1,559 francs in a market that rose 1.64 percent.\n-- Paris Newsroom, +33 1 4221 5452\n","classes":[25,26,44],"classes_pad":null}

Other members of the WTO argue that this tendency is increasingly emerging in local law in U.S. states, but is also reflected in the controversial Helms-Burton federal law on investment in Cuba.\nThe U.S. administration says it is working with officials from Massachusetts and the EU to solve the dispute -- apparently to achieve changes in the legislation to ensure it matches WTO rules.\nBut U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky has strongly criticised the Brussels decision to go to the WTO.\nIn a statement last month, she said the move was \"a counter-productive step, particularly in light of efforts that the United States and the (EU) have both taken to exert pressure on the repressive Burma regime\".\nUnder WTO rules, if the consultations do not produce a solution within 30 days, the EU could ask the 131-member organisation's Dispute Settlement Body to set up a neutral panel to determine whether the law violates global trade accords.\n","classes":[13,44,46,64,66,70,80,88,90,93,104],"classes_pad":null}

What's important is that (Priebke's) name will always be associated with shame,\" Giulia Spizzichino, who lost seven relations in the massacre, told reporters at the courthouse in Rome's Rebibbia jail.\nA three-judge panel convicted both Priebke and Hass for their part in the massacre in which SS soldiers rounded up 335 men and boys and shot them in the caves outside Rome in retaliation for a partisan attack on German occupying forces.\nBut it granted some mitigating circumstances, reducing the life sentences that both Germans could have faced to 15 years for Priebke and 10 years and eight months for Hass.\nAntonio Lepore, one of the judges, said in a statement read out to the court that the panel had taken into account that Priebke and Hass had been following orders.\nIn Hass's case, they also took note of the fact that his participation in the massacre was minimal, Lepore said.\nBoth Priebke, 83, and Hass, 84, have admitted shooting two victims each, but said they would have been killed themselves if they failed to follow orders. Priebke also said he ticked names off a list as victims arrived at the caves.\nLepore said further concessions were granted which cut the sentences to five years for Priebke and eight months for Hass.\nHass will not serve any time in jail because he has been held under house arrest since he was indicted in the case last November. Lepore said he would be freed immediately.\nNeither man was in court for the verdict.\n\"It is not a defeat but I am not satisfied...This is an Italian-style compromise,\" Priebke's defence lawyer Carlo Taormina told reporters.\nHe said he was heading for the Roman Catholic monastery near Rome where Priebke is being held to explain the verdict to him.\nTaormina said that, according to his calculations, Priebke only had six months and 15 days left to serve after discounting time spent in jail pending and during the hearings.\nMilitary prosecutor Antonino Intelisano had said earlier that Priebke had served around 3-1\/2 years in jail already in Argentina and Italy, leaving him some 1\/1-2 years left to serve.\nPriebke was extradited in November 1995 from Argentina where he had lived openly for almost half a century.\nShimon Samuels, Director of the Los Angeles-based International Affairs for the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which hunts ex-Nazis, said the verdict gave him \"partial satisfaction\" because it showed war criminals could not rest easily.\nBut he described as \"a joke\" the length of time Priebke would actually have to serve once mitigating circumstances and concessions had been taken into account.\nIntelisano, who had demanded a life sentence for Priebke and 24 years for Hass, highlighted that the judges had recognised there could be no statute of limitations in this kind of case.\n\"This is a very courageous affirmation and a turning point,\" he said.\nPriebke was declared free by a court in his first trial which ended in uproar last August 1. Although he was found guilty, the court said he could not be punished because of a statute of limitations -- meaning too much time had elapsed since the crimes were committed.\n\"I imagine that some people might think that this sentence is too lenient but it is not our role to judge that,\" Rome mayor Francesco Rutelli said after Tuesday's verdict.\n\"The important thing is that Priebke was convicted and therefore the court ruled that there can be no statute of limitation on crimes against humanity.\"\nPriebke and Hass were also ordered to pay unspecified damages as part of a civil suit brought by families of the victims.

Cockerill has an option to buy the rest of it before 1999.\nEisenhuettenstadt, built by communist East Germany in the 1950s as a model of industrial progress, and briefly named Stalinstadt after the Soviet dictator, declined after German unification in 1990 but was saved by cash injections from Bonn.\nKohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) are trailing badly in opinion polls in the region, but his visit looked unlikely to convince east Germans, increasingly sceptical about the \"blooming landscapes\" he promised in a 1990 unification pledge.\n\"The promises have always been there, but we still haven't seen any results,\" said Sylvia Eddert, 37, an unemployed sales assistant from Frankfurt-an-der-Oder.\nRetired railway worker Egon Butschkat, 61, from nearby Potsdam, was also sceptical about Kohl's ability to help them beat unemployment and economic stagnation.\n\"I don't really feel the government can do much to help us with our problems,\" he said. \"I think all this attention from politicians is just part of the election campaign.\"\nThe trip comes at a difficult period politically for the veteran chancellor.

Eisenhuettenstadt and Frankfurt are both in the state of Brandenburg.\n\"Without political backing and additional financial help from Bonn, Eko Stahl would have gone into liquidation a long time ago. The region is obliged to be grateful to the chancellor,\" the paper said.\nCommentators say that while Kohl made political capital by carrying off German unification, few believe he can fulfil his unification pledges to create a buoyant economy in the east, where unemployment currently averages 17 percent.\nSurveys show that a slim majority of Germans oppose Kohl's next pet project, the launch of Europe's single currency.

Operating losses from films had been expected to continue.\nFirst-half group sales climbed five percent to 4.53 billion guilders with music generating sales of 3.94 billion. Operating profit in music rose to 522 million guilders from 457 million during the half.\nThe film division saw first-half turnover dip to 589 million guilders from 681 million with operating losses widening to 92 million from 37 million.\nFilm's second-quarter operating loss was 37 million guilders compared to 55 million in the first quarter and 18 million in the second quarter of 1996.\nChief executive Alain Levy said the strategy at the film unit was on track to deliver break-even over the next two years.\n\"Film strategy is on target. We always said 1997 would be a year of transition. There's nothing there to worry about,\" he said. \"We say 1998-99 for operating profit from film,\" he said reiterating a previous PolyGram forecast.\nPolyGram said the results of its filmed entertainment business reflected the division's lighter release schedule during the first six months of 1997, adding the division expected its strongest releases in the second half.\nThe Dutch company, 75-percent owned by Philips Electronics NV, has recently released \"Bean\", starring Rowan Atkinson, to enthusiastic audiences in Australia and the Netherlands. It plans to release mainstream movie \"The Game\", starring Michael Douglas, in September.\nFilm during the first half of 1996 benefited from the success of \"Dead Man Walking\", \"Fargo\", and \"Mr Holland's Opus\".\nAt the first-quarter stage in April PolyGram said underperformance of previously released films \"Portrait of a Lady\" and \"Gridlock'd\" had hit its earnings.\nPolyGram said the combination of sales from established artists such as U2 and the Bee Gees, along with those from breakthrough artists such as Hanson had delivered results in the first half.\n\"Despite challenging conditions in some of our markets, PolyGram's expertise in breaking new acts and promoting established artists is reflected in the first half results,\" Levy said in a statement with results.\nU2 sold over five million copies of their album \"Pop\" in the first half, while the Bee Gees sold 2.3 million albums. Newcomers Hanson -- decades younger than the Bee Gee trio of brothers -- sold three million copies of their album \"Middle of Nowhere\" in the second quarter.\nIn total nine albums sold over one million copies in the first half, compared to 15 in the first six months of 1996 when PolyGram released a bigger number of superstar albums.\nTotal unit sales for the top five albums in the first half of 1997 was 15 million compared to 13 million for the comparable period in 1996.\nAnalysts said the company's performance was broadly as they expected, although the film side had been a little disappointing.\n\"It (the film operation) is loss-making and will remain so for the time being.

Erratic increases in value were the result,\" he said.\nBut he said European economic and monetary union (EMU) would insulate Germany from such swings.\n\"A more stable European currency could become an alternative to the U.S. dollar in the world currency system,\" Waigel said. \"As an export nation Germany would profit from a stable European bloc.\"\nMore stability would lead to lowering of capital market rates, while a pan-European denomination would increase price transparency and reduce exchange rate risks, he said.\nWaigel made few comments on the mark's current standing, except to say Germany was in contact with other nations regarding exchange rates.\nForeign exchange experts said the mark's weakening to below 1.81 to the dollar on Tuesday lent support to Waigel's argument for a common European currency.\n\"He is preparing the case for why Germany needs the euro,\" said Avinash Persaud, head of currency analysis at JP Morgan in London.\n\"The mark has gone through periods of excessive strength and weakness for reasons that don't have to do with fundamentals,\" he said. \"Today it's excessively weak because of the (lack of) credibility in the euro.\"\nWaigel was making the point that Germany would be better off \"with a euro that's bigger and safer\" than the mark, Persaud said.\n\"Germany has its trading partners (in Europe) constantly devaluing their currency against the mark, and that upsets the German manufacturing sector,\" he said. \"In that environment, it's better to have the euro.\"\nMoreover, as global financial markets open up, the mark would be subject to even more volatility, currency traders said.\n\"It's getting easier and easier to preserve wealth by switching large amounts of money from one reserve currency to another,\" another London trader said. \"That can be a disadvantage for the mark.\"\nWaigel's message has been getting through to the German business community. On Monday Siemens AG took time out from an earnings announcement to voice its backing for EMU.\nBut Waigel has yet to turn public opinion. Polls show most Germans oppose the euro and are unhappy with austerity measures he is imposing to keep Germany in line with the public deficit requirement of three percent of gross domestic product to qualify for EMU.\nOn Tuesday Waigel said Bonn would meet the criteria in 1997, and beat the targets next year.\n\"Based on current estimates, the total public sector deficit based on the national accounts will not exceed the limit of 3.0 percent (of GDP),\" Waigel said. \"We will hold to the Maastricht criteria in 1997 and improve in 1998.\"\n-- Bonn Newsroom, +49-228 26097150\n","classes":[46,70,80,81,84,90,116,118,123],"classes_pad":null}

U.S. police have mounted a massive manhunt for homosexual prostitute Andrew Cunanan, who is the only suspect.\nNilla Arman, 75, sitting a row from the front of the section of the cathedral given over to the public, said she admired Versace and wanted to pay her respects, adding: \"I was struck by his death.\"\nArman, who was wearing a brightly coloured dress, said she had admired his bold designs. \"I couldn't possibly wear them but I was more than happy to look at them.\"\nAlessandra Marcotti, 19, also from Milan, had come with her mother Daria, curious to see which famous names would turn up but also shocked and appalled by the designer's murder.\n\"He was a public figure. Even though he came from the south, he had his professional birth here and then went out into the world,\" Marcotti said.\nThe colourful t-shirts and jeans of curious tourists contrasted starkly with the sombre garb of the celebrities in black at the other end of the cathedral.\nMany of Versace's friends and family opted for muted outfits -- albeit beautifully tailored and with fine touches like gloves and the occasional hat or black lace head covering.\nDiminutive Donatella Versace, the designer's sister, arrived wearing a close fitting knee-length black dress, black gloves and a length of black lace over her long straight blonde hair.\nBritish supermodel Naomi Campbell, who had arrived at the Versace headquarters in tears, arrived in dark glasses, a slim black dress, high heels and lace over her hair.\nCzech supermodel Eva Herzigova turned up in black trousers, a black top and jacket while Princess Diana, hailed as one of the world's style icons, wore a black knee-length dress, jacket and white pearls with black tights and high-heeled shoes.\n","classes":[90,98,102,105],"classes_pad":null}

The present U.N. police strength of 300 would be cut to 250 and the U.N. troop strength of 500 reduced to a military headquarters staff of 50, he said.\nThe main objective would be to support the Haitian authorities in training the Haitian National Police and making it more professional.\nAnnan cited \"daunting political and economic challenges\" still facing the impoverished Caribbean country, where a 20,000-strong U.S.-led force in 1994 restored to power ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was succeeded in 1996 by President Rene Preval.\nA smaller U.N. force took over in March 1995 and has since been further reduced.\nThe last renewal of the current U.N. force, called the U.N. Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH), was billed as its final extension, with China and Russia particularly opposed to any further renewal.\nWith this in mind, Annan proposed setting up a new operation, to be called the U.N. Transition Mission in Haiti (UNTMIH).\nChina has long opposed the Haiti operation, mainly because of that country's ties to Taiwan, considered by Beijing a renegade province. Russia regards the situation in Haiti as calling for economic assistance rather than peacekeeping.\nAnnan said in his report that the 50 U.N. military headquarters personnel would be supplemented by contingents provided by Canada and Pakistan and funded by voluntary contributions from Canada and the United States. He did not give the size of the contingents.\nIn addition to some 450 Canadian and 45 Pakistani troops serving with the current U.N. mission, 300 Canadians and 500 Pakistanis are part of the U.N. force. They are maintained by U.S. and Canadian funding to meet demands, mainly by China and Russia, that the United Nations should pay for only 500 troops.\nAnnan said if Security Council members agreed with his recommendations he would submit details of the costs involved.\nIf the new operation were approved, he added, U.N. involvement in Haiti would not end on Nov. 30. He said it would be important for the international community to \"assist the activities of the government of Haiti aimed at the strengthening of democratic institutions, as well as to maintain a strong support to the building of a professional police force.\"\n","classes":[90,93],"classes_pad":null}

The government promised to reduce the deficit to three percent in 1998.\nBut with modest economic growth and no one-off 37 billion franc ($6.1 billion) payment from state-owned France Telecom which is being used to cut the 1997 deficit, it will face an uphill task.\n\"Growth won't do them any favours, France Telecom cannot be counted on next year and they will need to come up with something to fulfil their electoral pledges,\" said Williams.\nThe previous conservative government forecast 1998 growth at 2.8 percent compared with a minimum 2.3 percent in 1997. Private economists forecast 1998 growth at around 2.6 percent and growth this year at around 2.2 percent.\nEconomist Steven Englander of Smith Barney said without new measures, the deficit could be around 3.7 to 3.8 percent next year.\nEvery 0.1 percentage point of overshoot is calculated to represent around eight billion francs in revenue shortfall.\nTo get the deficit down to three percent, some 15 billion francs could come from improved revenues from better growth, while the rest would have to come from fiscal measures such as higher taxes and spending cuts, he said.\n\"They could take back income tax cuts on upper income groups, they may push up the wealth tax, in shifting the funding of health insurance from payroll to the CGS (a general tax levied on most forms of income), they may try to overfund it,\" Englander said.\n\"But it will be tough since they don't have any interest in shrinking the size of government,\" he said.\nSocialist party spokesman Francois Hollande indicated on Monday that the government might put an additional tax bite on wealthier citizens. Measures reflecting \"social fairness\" would be included in the 1998 budget. \"Those who have the most pay the most, that is completely normal,\" he said.\nHe also said the government could shift some of the tax burden from payrolls to investment revenues and overhaul social welfare financing.\nEconomists said the government's 15 percent tax hike on large companies to raise an extra 22 billion francs would dampen investment which is important for economic growth.\nOn top of its other troubles, the government may be forced to impose another tax to pay off the accumulated 1996-97 social security debt expected to be around 70 billion francs, said Eric Chaney of Morgan Stanley.\nDifficulties also loom on the civil service payroll front.\n\"When you look at the automatic growth of civil service payrolls, it represents around 30 billion francs,\" Chaney said.\n\"I do not see how the government could stabilise the deficit at the 1997 level without freezing wages for civil servants...clearly the trade unions will oppose this.\n\"I'm afraid at the end of the day there will be some creative accounting,\" he said, suggesting that the government might tap non-fiscal revenue sources such as the state-owned Caisse des Depots et Consignations.\nMany economists believe that Germany would accept France having a 1997 deficit of 3.2 or 3.3 percent. France has urged a flexible interpretation of Maastricht based on progress toward three percent.\nBut Chaney said France would have to pledge to bring the deficit below three percent in 1998 to achieve credibility with its EU partners, saying: \"I think it has to be below (three percent) as a kind of guarantee it will not exceed three percent.\" ($ = 6.082 French Francs)\n","classes":[46,55,56,70,80,84,90,104],"classes_pad":null}

He owns rival daily La Tribune, the magazine Investir and an indirect 25 percent stake in the fourth-largest quoted French company.\n\"It's a matter of finding the right opportunities at the right time,\" Arnault told Les Echos recently.\nIndustry experts say his success lies in bringing modern business management to the luxury goods sector without killing the separate cultures that nurture creative talents at Christian Dior, Guerlain, Kenzo and his other houses.\nArnault was born in 1949 in the northern industrial town of Roubaix, and retains the reserved manner of the region.\nHis first love was music, but he studied mathematics at the most prestigious French college, the Ecole Polytechnique, and returned to work at his family's property development company.\nHe left France in 1981 after a Socialist was elected president. After spending three years developing properties in Florida with little success, he returned when a friend suggested he bid for a loss-making firm the government was keen to sell.\nThe group, Agache-Willot, owned the Boussac textile firm and the fashion house Christian Dior, which became the cornerstone of Arnault's empire. He sold off the other assets, sparking an outcry that he had stripped the company.\nSimilar accusations of ruthlessness followed his moves to hire Christian Lacroix away from Jean Patou and his purchase of the designer leather goods firm Celine from its founders.\nArnault's big break came when the 1987 merger of the Moet Hennessy group with Louis Vuitton to form LVMH began to sour.\nLouis Vuitton's boss Henry Racamier invited Arnault and his then partner Guinness to take stakes in LVMH to check the perceived ambitions of Moet Hennessy chairman Alain Chevalier.\nThe uneasy four-way partnership turned into a boardroom brawl. Chevalier quit after a failed bid to break up the group, and Racamier was forced out in April 1990 after a court fight.\nLVMH has since acquired leather goods firm Loewe, Fred jewellers, and last year said it had bought the acclaimed Chateau d'Yquem vineyard from a feuding aristocratic family.\nLVMH is fighting in court against the manager of the Yquem property, Count Alexandre de Lur Saluces, who claims his brother had no right to sell control.\nArnault, who once dreamed of being a concert pianist, is married to one, Canadian-born Helene Mercier, and has three children, including two from his first marriage.

Its share price closed floor trade up 6.90 marks or 12 percent at 63 marks amid vague takeover speculation.\nMeanwhile some analysts see a distinct possibility that Dresdner may eventually join forces in some form with the new Bavarian giant, which will be called Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG (BHV).\nThat would provide BHV with the investment banking base it lacks and giving it a nationwide retail branch network. BHV's branches will be largely confined to southern Germany.\nSuch a move would probably not be blocked by cartel authorities given the fragmented nature of Germany's banking market. Even Deutsche, Europe's largest bank, has just five percent of the German banking market.\nAnalysts said any link-up between Dresdner and BHV would probably incorporate Allianz given the sizeable cross-shareholdings among the groups. Allianz owns roughly 22 percent of Dresdner and will own about 16 percent of BHV while Dresdner holds 10 percent of Allianz.\n\"I can imagine a combination of Dresdner and BHV, that would make sense,\" said Andreas Thielen, an analyst at Enskilda Securities in London. \"Dresdner and BHV would be a strong combination with Allianz as big shareholder in the background.\"\nDeutsche's leading position is not seen under threat from the merger but any link-up between Dresdner and BHV could force it to take action, analysts said.\nAnalysts praised what they called an elegant merger deal between Vereinsbank and Hypo-Bank because it involves the tax efficient exchange of Allianz shares from Vereinsbank's portfolio in return for Hypo-Bank shares.\nGiven German banks' voluminous holdings of financial and industrial stakes, the Munich merger could pave the way for similar cost-efficient link-ups elsewhere in the sector.\n\"The way it's been financed has opened up a whole range of possibilities because it's extraordinarily elegant,\" said Crossly at ABN Amro Hoare Govett. \"There is a lot of potential war chest money at Deutsche and Dresdner.\"\n--Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525 ($ = 1.804 German Marks)\n","classes":[15,18,25,26,44],"classes_pad":null}

Sarkuhi was arrested in April.\n\"Despite world-wide protests and the efforts of your government, Sarkuhi is still in jail,\" the group told Kohl.\nIt urged him to use all means at his disposal to influence the case and said he could at the very least demand that Sarkuhi's trial, announced last month and due to take place soon, be observed by an international commission.\nThe writers said Tehran's decision to put Sarkuhi on trial was a direct reaction to a verdict by a German court in April that Iran's leadership ordered the killing of a group of Iranian Kurdish dissidents in Berlin in 1992.\nIran denies involvement in the killings.\nBonn feels some responsibility for Sarkuhi because his wife has received asylum in Germany. It had been in regular contact with Tehran over the case.\nBut after downgrading relations with Iran following the Berlin court ruling, it said it could no longer intercede for him.\nThe exiled writers slammed Bonn's approach.\n\"To our amazement your government is continuing close co-operation with Iran, although German justice put Iranian state terrorism on the record,\" the group wrote.\n\"What makes us sorry is that your economic interests take precedence over human rights. That is what world public opinion will condemn you for if anything happens to Sarkuhi.\"\nIn a letter smuggled out of Iran, Sarkuhi said he had been held for six weeks and tortured by the Iranian secret service in Tehran late last year to force him to confess to spying for Germany.\nLast week Iran's own Islamic Human Rights Commission said Sarkuhi had written to it confessing to certain violations of the law and rejecting interference by foreign governments including Germany. It also said he would be tried in open court.\nThe U.S.-based group Human Rights Watch said in an open letter last month to the head of Iran's judiciary, Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, that it feared the charges might have been brought to punish Sarkuhi for his activities as a writer and to intimidate other independent-minded writers in Iran.\n","classes":[90,91,93],"classes_pad":null}

But Legras said he was more surprised not to have heard complaints from Washington rather than the EU's own farm lobby.\n\"The Americans will certainly protest. What surprises me is we haven't had some communiques already,\" he said.\n\"This is how we read it and the accord was always negiotated in this way. If we want to exit from the constraints of Blair House then this is the only way to do it,\" he said.\nLegras was the main EU official responsible for finalising the deal, which took seven years to negotiate and provoked sharp clashes between Europe and Washington.\nBut a French oilseed lobby accused Legras of overconfidence and said Blair House should be renegotiated to let Europeans produce more -- something Washington has refused unless EU concessions are on the table first.\n\"Legras is making a mistake. He must renegotiate Blair House,\" said Jean-Claude Sabin, boss of the FOP oilseed union.\nA U.S. reaction was not immediately available but diplomats based in Europe said Legras' remarks would be studied closely. Fathoming out the accord is difficult because it has never been officially published. Instead, it was formalised by an exchange of letters between Washington and the European Commission, and a formal signing in Brussels.\nThe deal limits EU oilseed plantings to a basic level of 4.934 million hectares. (12.5 million acres) This is reduced by whatever set-aside rate the EU has in force to limit crop sowings, currently five percent.\nAgenda 2000 proposes payments of 66 Ecus a tonne for grain and oilseeds compared with current levels of 94 Ecus for oilseeds and 54.35 for cereals.

Sharma, secretary general of the Federation of Indian Mineral Industries (FIMI), which has 350 mining and metal firms as members.\nLast week South Africa's De Beers decided against bidding for diamond mining rights in the central state of Madhya Pradesh after the government refused to let it sell diamonds mined in the state through its Central Selling Organisation (CSO).\nThe government wanted to sell the diamonds by open auction.\nIndia in 1993 dispensed with the exclusive role of the state sector in exploration and exploitation of 13 minerals including iron ore, manganese ore, gold, diamond, copper, lead, zinc and nickel and threw the doors open to the private sector.\nIt has made changes in its laws since then to encourage foreign equity investment in the mining sector.\nMany Australian, British and Canadian mining firms have expressed interest in the prospecting of gold, diamonds, zinc, copper and lead in the states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.\nIndia has rich bauxite, copper, iron ore, lead and granite resources. It is the largest consumer of gold and the biggest centre in the world for diamond cutting and polishing.\nSharma said companies interested in entering India include BHP Minerals (India) Ltd, a unit of Australia's BHP, Pasminco, and CRA Exploration India Ltd, a unit of Rio Tinto Plc\/Ltd.\nIn October 1996 the government responded to investor concerns by increasing the area for prospecting for minerals to 5,000 sq km from 25 sq km per exploration to facilitate aerial prospecting.\nMines Secretary B.B. Tandon told a seminar in London in early July that nine proposals for prospecting over large areas had since been approved.\nMines Minister Birendra Prasad Baishya told reporters in the Indian capital on Tuesday that prospecting licences had been granted over more than 20,000 sq km area.\nThe companies given approval for prospecting include BHP Mineral India Ltd, CRA Explorationb India Ltd and state-run Hindustan Zinc Ltd.\nBaishya said 36 proposals with an investment of 25 billion rupees have been approved for foreign equity participation in mining and allied sectors.\n\"We have set all the policy parameters in place and things should move,\" Tandon told the same news conference.\nBut industry officials and experts said more was needed to quicken the pace.\n\"In October they increased the area, nine months have lapsed and nothing has happened,\" said Sharma.\nIndustry officials said while the government had increased the prospecting area, clearances from the military and civil aviation authorities were needed for aerial prospecting.\n\"The first hurdle was aerial survey. Now you need to go from door to door,\" said R. Thakore, FIMI President and director of Calcutta-based Aryan Mining.\nThakore said the government needed to decide if a prospective area was worth exploiting for its minerals or better left untouched as forest reserves.\n","classes":[15,18,29,32,44],"classes_pad":null}

Both of them believe the Congress party will support the resolution.\n----\nThe Times Of India\nRALLY ADDRESSED BY PASWAN DISRUPTED\nSupporters of Bihar state Chief Minister Laloo Prasad Yadav disrupted a public meeting addressed by Railway Minister Ram Vilas Paswan and Janata Dal party leader Sharad Yadav in Bihar. They also stoned the motorcade of Paswan and hurled a bomb at the dais. The bomb landed behind the dais but no one was hurt. The foundation-laying function of a railway track, which the two leaders were attending, was marred by brickbating and the smashing of window panes of vehicles.\n----\nThe Economic Times\nTELEPHONE SERVICE PROVIDER TO ENTER GLOBAL MARKET\nThe state-owned fixed telephone service provider for Delhi and Bombay the Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL) is likely to hit the global market with a $850-million Global Depositary Receipt (GDR). It will be the largest ever GDR issue by an Indian company overseas.\n----  \nFinancial Express\nFIAT TO INVEST $1BLN IN INDIA IN FIVE YEARS\nFiat International has earmarked $1 billion for investment in India between 1997 and 2002 for its present and future joint venture plans. Fiat Spa's chief executive officer Paolo Cantarella said these investments related to the main sectors in which the group operated. The Fiat Auto India which is a joint venture company set up recently will make Fiat's world car Palio in a plant in the Maharashtra state.\n----\nFUJITSU SETS EYE ON RPG STAKE\nJapanese company Fujitsu is negotiating with the RPG enterprises to buy a major portion of its 30 percent stake in Fujitsu ICIM. This will help Fujitsu to raise its stake to about 45 percent in the company. The ICL of the United Kingdom holds 27 percent stake in Fujitsu ICIM. The remaining 33 percent stake is held by the public and the financial institutions.\n----\nBusiness Standard\nSLIDE IN NON-FOOD BANK CREDIT CHECKED\nThe continuous slide in non-food bank credit was finally arrested as it rose by 18.51 billion rupees in the fortnight ended July 4, 1997. The rise in credit offtake against the backdrop of increased investment by banks in debentures, bonds and commercial papers of corporates presents a better picture of the credit scenario of the economy. The declining non-food credit was perked up by the slicing in bank rate by the Reserve Bank for the second time on June 25 al norms through which the potential risk of import duty slash that might affect certain industries could be checked. The IDBI may not consider a project for lending unless it is globally competitive in terms of productivity, quality and pricing. The ICICI too is believed to have adopted a similar policy.\n","classes":[90],"classes_pad":null}

The move was aimed at increasing Russia's revenues from payments, the official said.\nA Russian Embassy spokesman in New Delhi said Russia wanted all its debtors to repay in hard currency but there were no specific negotiations with India on the subject.\n\"Ever since Anatoly Chubais took over as the Deputy Prime Minister he has been pressing for the payment of debts in hard currency and it is part of that drive...there is nothing specific about debt from India,\" the spokesman said.\nHe added that the issue might be discussed when Chubais, who is also Russia's finance minister and the architect of the post-communist privatisation programme, visits India later this year.\n\"Chubais might lead a delegation to India sometime in September or October, and the whole issue might be discussed at length,\" the spokesman added.\nIndia is one of Russia's biggest debtors along with Iraq, Libya and Cuba. Unlike many others, it regularly makes payments in accordance with original contracts.\nBut payments are in rupees, which are later sold by Russia's state-owned Vneshekonombank at a discount.\nDuring the Cold War, India enjoyed a special trade facility which allowed it to use the rupee -- not a \"hard\", or convertible, currency -- to pay for Soviet goods. The Soviet Union was India's main arms supplier and steel partner.\nIn 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin visited India and signed an agreement which required India to repay $10 billion in the form of goods worth $1 billion every year over the next 12 years. But things have not gone according to plan, and Russia has never managed to purchase $1 billion worth of goods each year.\n\"Russia has bought goods worth about $2 billion in the last five years,\" M.S. Lakshmi, a Russia expert at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT) said.\nSanjeev Reddy, director general of the IIFT, said India's balance of payments could enable the country to make part payment in hard currency but that would be detrimental to its exports.\n\"If we repay Russia in hard currency we might hamper our own export prospects as the Russians might buy what they do from India from other countries,\" said Reddy.\n","classes":[55,57,70,90,93],"classes_pad":null}

The companies are owed the money for selling petroleum products below market prices to support India's subsidy regime.\nThe oil pool deficit is about 190 billion rupees ($5.3 billion), up from 155 billion at the start of the financial year on April 1.\nThe ruling United Front coalition's policy-making steering committee has failed in its last two meetings to solve the oil riddle, and a third meeting has been deferred several times.\nThe timing of the increase has been clouded by the continuing dissension within Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral's fragile coalition. The coalition is due to debate whether or not to admit a breakaway faction of Gujral's Janata Dal party at a meeting this Friday.\n($1 = 35.7 rupees)\n","classes":[13,33,44],"classes_pad":null}

They just want to get back to a normal life,\" said Ketheshwaran Longanathan, a columnist and author of books on the crisis.\nBut peace may still be elusive as gunfire continues to echo in the troubled north and east, and the country counts an ever-rising tally of its dead.\nThe war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) began in earnest on July 23, 1983 when the rebels killed 13 Sinhalese soldiers in the north of the island, prompting a backlash against minority Tamils.\nIsland-wide anti-Tamil riots broke out a day later in which at least 400 people were killed.\nThe government says the death toll in the war against LTTE, who demand a separate homeland for Tamils in the island's north and east, is more than 50,000. The LTTE put the toll higher.\nA government plan to seek a political solution to the conflict has bogged down as political parties squabble over proposed constitutional reforms aimed at ending the war.\nThe reform package is being debated in a parliamentary select committee, which is negotiating key issues such as devolution of power to minorities and demarcation of proposed new administrative councils in Sri Lanka's north and east.\nA military offensive in the north,  launched in May to open a strategic northern highway and deal a blow to the LTTE's fighting machinery, has slowed after two major counter-attacks by the rebels.\nBut the government seems firm in its resolve to continue the battle to neutralise the LTTE militarily and at the same time work on constitutional reforms to push the rebels into a corner.\n\"A politico-military solution to the problem is the only approach possible,\" Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.\n\"The other option is to give a separate state to (LTTE leader Velupillai) Prabhakaran, which is absolutely not possible.\"\nSupport for a rapid end to the conflict has, however, expanded after the ruling People's Alliance (PA) government, which won power in 1994 after 17 years of rule by the United National Party (UNP), offered to devolve powers to minorities.\n\"The war has taken a heavy toll on both Tamils and Sinhalese. It has contributed to strengthening the peace constituency,\" said Ketheswaran.\n\"The state lost out in the past because of the delay in coming out with a political solution. At least this (PA) government is introducing the people to devolution,\" he said.\nKadirgamar, who maintained there was little possibility of talks with the rebels until they laid down their arms, said the LTTE had at least brought the Tamils to the fore of national politics.\n\"The problem would have been pushed away had it not been for the LTTE,\" Kadirgamar said.\nBut the minister added that Prabhakaran or the LTTE did not represent the Tamil people. \"What he represents is some Tamil people sitting in their drawing rooms in Washington, London and Canberra. They are working out their dreams and Prabhakaran is fighting for them.\"\nThe LTTE rose to prominence in 1980s with help from the Indian government, which provided arms and training, and later by decimating other Tamil guerrilla groups active in Sri Lanka.\nWith access to international arms markets and funds from the Tamil diaspora, the LTTE have emerged as a potent military force, committed to the cause of a separate homeland, or Eelam.\nSri Lankans worry whether military neutralisation and devolution of power to minorities would really bring the LTTE to the negotiating table.\n\"In my assessment, the LTTE leadership is committed to the goal of Tamil Eelam. Devolution is a headache for LTTE since its acceptance undermines its entire ideological thrust,\" Ketheshwaran said.\n\"I have my doubts they will come around. They are hooked to the possibility of getting Eelam,\" he said.\n","classes":[90,104,110],"classes_pad":null}

Sharma, secretary general of the Federation of Indian Mineral Industries (FIMI), which has 350 mining and metal firms as members.\nLast week South Africa's De Beers decided against bidding for diamond mining rights in the central state of Madhya Pradesh after the government refused to let it sell diamonds mined in the state through its Central Selling Organisation (CSO).\nThe government wanted to sell the diamonds by open auction.\nIndia in 1993 dispensed with the exclusive role of the state sector in exploration and exploitation of 13 minerals including iron ore, manganese ore, gold, diamond, copper, lead, zinc and nickel and threw the doors open to the private sector.\nIt has made changes in its laws since then to encourage foreign equity investment in the mining sector.\nMany Australian, British and Canadian mining firms have expressed interest in the prospecting of gold, diamonds, zinc, copper and lead in the states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.\nIndia has rich bauxite, copper, iron ore, lead and granite resources. It is the largest consumer of gold and the biggest centre in the world for diamond cutting and polishing.\nSharma said companies interested in entering India include BHP Minerals (India) Ltd, a unit of Australia's BHP, Pasminco, and CRA Exploration India Ltd, a unit of Rio Tinto Plc\/Ltd. In October 1996 the government responded to investor concerns by increasing the area for prospecting for minerals to 5,000 sq km from 25 sq km per exploration to facilitate aerial prospecting.\nMines Secretary B.B. Tandon told a seminar in London in early July that nine proposals for prospecting over large areas had since been approved.\nBut industry officials and experts said more was needed to quicken the pace.\n\"In October they increased the area, nine months have lapsed and nothing has happened,\" said Sharma.\nIndustry officials said while the government had increased the prospecting area, clearances from the military and civil aviation authorities were needed for aerial prospecting.\n\"The first hurdle was aerial survey. Now you need to go from door to door,\" said R. Thakore, FIMI President and director of Calcutta-based Aryan Mining.\nThakore said the government needed to decide if a prospective area was worth exploiting for its minerals or better left untouched as forest reserves.\n\"Virtually nothing has been done on the ground. There is no concrete work,\" he said. \"They (investors) can go to Indonesia or Philippines where they are being welcomed with open arms.\"\nSharma said state firms appointed as central agencies for exploitation were demanding \"sweet equity\" without contributing financial equity, a move resisted by foreign firms.\n\"We have to relax our tax systems. Such rebates are available in other countries like the Philippines, Indonesia, Brazil and Chile,\" said a mineral expert with a government undertaking.\n","classes":[11,13,32,44,64,70],"classes_pad":null}

{"codes":["C11","C24","CCAT"],"headline":"Fiat's India success a long and winding road.","text":"\nItalian carmaker Fiat SpA's decision to invest close to $1.0 billion in India over the next five year may not be enough to put it in a position of strength in the country's automobile industry, analysts said on Monday.\nThe company announced that its investment would go into ventures to make cars, trucks, automobile components and robotic production equipment.\nFiat sold its first car in India more than 90 years ago, and local versions of its 1100 and 124 models continue to be made by Bombay-based Premier Automobiles Ltd (PAL).\nBut Fiat has not been very successful with its recent initiatives in India.\nPAL launched the Fiat Uno in India last year, but labour unrest at its plant near Bombay caused poor production, unsatisfied demand, and a rash of cancelled bookings.\nTwo years ago, India's second largest commercial vehicle manufacturer, Ashok Leyland Ltd introduced Fiat's Iveco truck unit's Cargo series in India. Fewer than 5,000 were sold in 1996\/97 (April-March).\n\"There is nothing wrong with Fiat's products. But both the Uno and the Cargo trucks have suffered as Fiat's partners did not have the wherewithal to promote and push its products as required,\" Rohit Rana, automobile analyst at SocGen Crosby said.\nHe said Fiat would have done much better if it had decided to come in on its own two years ago. Fiat's $1.0 billion investment plan involves several minority Indian partners in different projects.\nFiat is betting largely on its Palio world car to bring home the bacon in India, and to repeat the success it had in Brazil, where it has sold 300,000 Palios in the year since they were launched.\nThe Italian group recently received approval from the Indian government to set up a $558 million joint venture with PAL to make the Palio in India, in which it will own 74 percent equity.\nPaolo Cantarella, Fiat's chief executive officer, expects the venture to start production by late 1999, and make 100,000 cars at full capacity.\nBut it may well be too late by then. Rana estimates that the market for mid-size cars will be about 120,000 by 2000, while local production will total over 500,000.\n\"It's going to be a cut-throat market, and the later you launch your products, the tougher it is to make a mark,\" he said.\nFiat has to contend with the fact that some of its competitors are already in India in strength, and have their cars on the market.\nSouth Korea's Daewoo Corp, Ford Motor Co and General Motors Corp have already launched their cars in India, and Honda Motor Co, Mitsubishi Motor Co, and Hyundai Motor Co are all in the process of doing so.\nThe giant in the field is Maruti Udyog Ltd, an equal joint venture between Suzuki Motor Corp and the Indian government, which has 70 percent of the Indian car market.\n\"Fiat's products until now had not been cost competitive in India. The Cargo trucks are 10 to 12 percent more costly than the competition. And for about the same price, the Uno is an old car in comparison with the Maruti Zen,\" said Jardine Fleming's automobile analyst K.N. Srinivasan.\nHe said it was unlikely that Fiat would make a dent in this market in the short term.\n\"It will have to invest heavily in product promotion and distribution to make any headway when it launches its car in late 1999. It is still low on aggression when it comes to India as compared to companies like Daewoo,\" Srinivasan said.\n-- New Delhi newsroom +91 11 301 2024\n","classes":[11,32,44],"classes_pad":null}

At every stop we need to pay something in cash or kind,\" he said.\nBANGLADESH GROWING AS MARKET FOR INDIAN GOODS\nIndia's exports to Bangladesh, growing at an annual rate of 20 to 25 percent, reached $1.2 billion in 1995\/96 while its imports from Bangladesh were $70 million.\nBut trading sources claim another $2 billion or more worth of Indian goods are smuggled into Bangladesh a year, making the country India's fifth largest export source.\nThree years ago Bangladesh introduced a tax for importing cattle from India, but hardly 20 percent of some 200,000 head of cattle brought in every month are actually taxed, traders said.\nOfficials and non-government organisations working in Chapainawabganj and neighbouring Rajshahi district said at least 70 percent of the region's population were directly or indirectly involved in smuggling.\n\"It's a means to overcome unemployment and poverty. Some people who are not poor also get into the business (of smuggling) to become more rich, in a short-cut way,\" Mollah said.\n\"The battle for survival is very tough here,\" said a local council official. \"Only a few people own most of the land and they cheat others who sell their labour,\" he added.\nINDIA OFFERS CHEAPER GOODS\nIndian goods are much cheaper. A kilogram of Indian sugar sells for 25 taka in Chapainawabganj against 35 or 40 taka for locally produced sugar.\nA new Indian bicycle is available for 1,200 taka, three times cheaper than a Bangladeshi bicycle.\nAt weekly markets along the borders, sellers from the other side step in without passport or visa.\nBangladeshis also visit India frequently without travel documents.\nSMUGGLING IS A FREE-FOR-ALL TRADE\nItems smuggled from Bangladesh are few but costly. They include jewellery, electronics, and foreign-made cosmetics and cigarettes.\nDrugs available from India include cocaine, heroin and Phensidyl, a cough syrup made with codeine phosphate, which anti-narcotics officials say is now most widely used in Bangladesh.\nBangladesh banned production of cough syrup with codeine phosphate, a substance derived from cocaine, in 1982.\nIn the village of Tappu, overlooking India's Telkupi village, smugglers ferried goods on their heads or in bullock-carts in broad daylight. Women gave them a helping hand.\nA police officer in Chapainawabganj blamed the spate of smuggling on grinding poverty along the frontiers and the apathy of successive governments to help them.\n","classes":[64,66,70,90,91],"classes_pad":null}

{"codes":["C12","CCAT","GCAT","GCRIM","GHEA"],"headline":"Witness says cigarette smoke was little tracked on U.S. planes.","text":"\nDangerous secondhand-smoke conditions aboard U.S. airline cabins went unmonitored for decades because of missteps by federal regulators, a co-author of a blue-ribbon scientific study said on Tuesday at a $5 billion secondhand-smoke trial.\nDonald Stedman, a member of a National Academy of Sciences study group which urged a ban on smoking in airline cabins, testified that the air quality in pilots' cabins was monitored for safety by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). However, up to 1986 no government agency tracked air quality in the cabins for passengers and flight attendants, the air pollution expert said.\n\"The Federal Aviation Administration were really worried about the air quality for the pilots and that they were kept healthy but considered that they had no jurisdiction over the cabin attendants. They thought OSHA (Occupation Safety and Health Administration) was taking care of that,\" Stedman said.\n\"Bt OSHA thought that FAA took of everything that was in the air and so they weren't caring about that. We perceived that this was a group of people here who ... had fallen through a crack,\" he said.\nOSHA is a federal agency charged with ensuring safe workplaces.\nStedman, a chemist at the University of Denver, said his panel investigated secondhand smoke aboard U.S. airlines in 1984 and 1985, and issued a report recommending a ban on in-flight smoking in 1986. Such a ban was ordered two years later.\n\"We know that the people most at risk were flight attendants,\" Stedman said under questioning by an attorney suing the tobacco industry on behalf of an estimated 60,000 nonsmoking flight attendants .\nHe said flight attendants were especially vulnerable to secondhand smoke because they were exerting themselves waiting on passengers through their flights and that the galleys, where they spent much of their worktime, were typically in the rear smoking sections of airliners.\n\"We saw no evidence that running up and down in an ETS (environmental tobacco smoke) environment was good for them,\" Stedman said during questioning by Walter Cofer, an attorney for defendants Philip Morris and Lorrillard.\nTobacco company lawyers fighting the lawsuit brought by the flight attendants -- who claim their respiratory, heart and other illnesses were caused by passengers smoking -- argue that flight attendants exposure to secondhand smoke was trivial and their illnesses may have been caused by other health risks such as ozone and cosmic radiation.\n\"We certainly believed that ETS was the major health risk faced by passengers or cabin crew in airlines,\" Stedman said.\nDuring questioning by Cofer, Stedman said he knew nothing of a U.S. Department of Transportation written response to his panel's report that the Department of Transporation had been responsible for monitoring air quality in passenger jets.\nTestimony in the case, the first class action against the tobacco industry to go to trial and the first involving secondhand-smoke claims, was scheduled to continue through September.

Licensees can submit their own calculations but it is up to the ITC to set the financial terms.\nA number of ITV companies have been lobbying for a reduction in their licence payments, pointing out the wide variation in payments across the ITV network.\nCarlton Communications Plc makes a fixed cash payment of over 46 million stg for its London licence but pays little more than 2,000 stg for its Central TV franchise in the English Midlands. Central made a nominal bid because it was the sole bidder for its licence.\nCompanies seeking renewal from 1999 must inform the ITC by May 1998. New financial terms will be offered in September or October and an answer required from the licensee by December.\nThose refusing the new terms at this stage will have a second chance to apply but later applicants will not be given this opportunity.\nThe final date for licence renewal will be December 2000, with the new licences taking effect from 2001. Licences not renewed at that date will be re-advertised and re-awarded, a process which takes two years.\n-- Keith Weir, London Newsroom +44 171 542 8793\n","classes":[13,16],"classes_pad":null}

Tuesday reported its best quarter ever for sales and profits and forecast moderately higher results in the second half of 1997.\nA 17 percent rise in sales fuelled a 16 percent surge in profit, Caterpillar said.\nThe nation's largest maker of heavy equipment and farm machinery said earnings jumped to $435 million for the second quarter ended June 30, up from $374 million a year earlier. Sales rose to $4.87 billion from $4.18 billion.\nThe results equalled $1.15 a share, up from 97 cents a share a year earlier, and surpassed analysts' estimates of $1.09 a share. But Caterpillar stock fell $1.19 to $55.56 in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading, as investors took profits after a strong runup in the stock for much of the year.\nCaterpillar's statement saying sales and profits would be \"moderately higher\" in the second half was \"very extensive, very upbeat and for a second-quarter release very unusual for these guys to do,\" said J. Blair Brumley, analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc.\nThe company reported sales of $8.5 billion and profits of $691 million for the second half of 1996.\nEconomies around the world are improving, mainly due to the surprising strength of the U.S. economy, and Caterpillar gets nearly half its sales outside the United States. U.S. sales grew 20 percent to $2.42 billion while sales outside the United States rose 14 percent $2.26 billion in the quarter.\nThe company said it expects demand for machines and engines to rise this year and remain at strong levels next year despite slower economic growth in the United States.\nCaterpillar said tight fiscal policies in Europe may cause a slight decline in demand for construction equipment for the rest of 1997, while in Japan tax increases and lower public works spending should slow demand for the rest of the year.\nDemand in Europe and Japan should improve next year, though uncertainties over public spending and other aspects of government policy remain for both regions, it said.\n\"Europe is very important to us, and we're starting to see, I think, some stirrings of a little stronger economy,\" Chief Financial Officer Douglas Oberhelman said in an interview.\nRegarding the drop in Caterpillar's stock, he said, \"I think it's the old adage of buy the rumour, sell the news.\"\nOperating profit margins rose to 26.2 percent of sales in the latest quarter from 25.7 percent a year earlier.\nHigher unit sales and cost increases over the past year were partly offset by an unfavourable change in product sales mix and increased fixed manufacturing costs, the company said.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses rose 18 percent to $483 million as Caterpillar boosted spending on growth and product line expansion.\n\"I think Caterpillar realises that many marketplaces are mature,\" said Thomas Burns Jr. at Natwest Securities Corp. \"You need more product lines.\"\n","classes":[15,16,44],"classes_pad":null}

He said it was too early to estimate costs of the whole reconstruction.\nThe programme will offer cheap loans, more credit guarantees, breaks on income and value added tax for companies damaged by the flood, as well as delays in some obligatory payments to the treasury.\nThe government will also spend 300 million zlotys ($86.3 million) to subsidise loans to help flood victims rebuild or renovate their houses and flats. About 1,000 homes will be built for those who cannot afford the loans.\nThe havoc wrought by the weekend rain has been less than the first catastrophe unleased by downpours in early July, which struck more than 1,000 villages and towns while also devastating much of the neighbouring Czech Republic.\nFor Wroclaw, with weakened flood dykes and struggling with a lack of clean water which threatened residents with dysentery and salmonella, the surge expected on Thursday was menacing. But local officials said only one district was in grave danger.\nThe earlier Odra wave was at last approaching the sea, lapping ominously at some areas near the port city of Szczecin.\nElsewhere, citizens and tens of thousands of troops worked shoring up sandbag barriers to contain local flood emergencies.\nAs the waters ebbed away, many Poles were in despair.\n\"If it wasn't for the children, I would have thrown myself into this water,\" book-keeper Katarzyna Lameta told a reporter in the town of Klodzko, which looked as though it had suffered a bombardment and where ruined buildings were layered in filth.\n\"How are we going to live here now?\" she said.\nPrime Minister Cimoszewicz apologised for telling ruined farmers before the full horror of the disaster became apparent that they should have been insured and could not expect help from government reserves.\n\"To everyone, and especially to flood victims, I simply say sorry for my inappropriate remark,\" Cimoszewicz said.\nOpposition parties say the government has been slow and inept in its response to the floods. The ex-communist Cimoszewicz rejects the charge, stressing that the extent of the floods took everyone by surprise.\nAnalysts said the flood aftermath could affect the outcome of September 21 parliamentary elections.\n($ = 3.475 Polish Zlotys)\n","classes":[90,94,97,113],"classes_pad":null}

A final decision is expected on Wednesday. Regulators had been set to rule against the merger.\n\"There remains the very real possibility that it will be possible to reach agreement,\" British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said.\n\"I think there's a way to work this out,\" Clinton told reporters in Washington. \"I am hopeful that by Wednesday, when the commission meets, that an agreement will have been reached.\"\nThe comments came after EU competition chief Karel Van Miert told a meeting of European foreign ministers that Boeing had moved to ease its position on controversial exclusive contracts to supply jetliners to major U.S. airlines.\n\"According to Van Miert, there appear to be signs that the American side is softening its position on the issue of (exclusive contracts) in the merger case,\" German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said.\nThe long-term contracts with American Airlines, Continental Airlines and Delta Air Lines remained the most contentious point in the talks between the Commission and Boeing. Boeing's vice president for European affairs, Jim Frank, declined to comment on the new offer.\nThe commission had been ready to block the deal on the grounds that it would harm fair competition in Europe and hurt Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft maker, EU sources said. But Boeing faxed new proposals to the commission Tuesday.\nThe commission and EU countries have been under intense pressure from Clinton and members of the U.S. Congress who warned a trade war could result if the deal was blocked.\nKinkel said that a trade war must be avoided.\n\"We cannot in any case let a trade war happen just because the concerned parties have little notion of reality,\" Kinkel told reporters. He said he had discussed the issue with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright by telephone on Monday and European Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan.\nBoeing's latest proposals came after the two sides broke off talks last week. Boeing's Executive Vice-President Richard Albrecht has been in Brussels since Friday.\nBoeing said Albrecht would hold a news conference on Wednesday afternoon after Van Miert briefed reporters on the commission's decision. The commission can block the deal if it finds it would harm fair competition in the EU. Were Boeing to proceed with the merger regardless, it could impose fines up to 10 percent of the companies' sales.\nRegulators in Washington approved the deal without conditions on July 1.\nCommission officials believed the deal would strengthen Boeing's already dominant position in the commercial sector, a conclusion rejected by the manufacturer, which argues that McDonnell Douglas no longer constitutes a serious competitor.\nMcDonnell Douglas' strength in the military sector also raised worries among European regulators that Boeing would benefit from defence funds to subsidise its commercial operations.\nBut the most contentious point remained the supply contracts. Boeing said last week it would cut the length of the pacts to 13 years from 25 and would not sign new ones for 10 years. But EU sources said that was not sufficient.\nStatements that the merger would be blocked triggered a barrage of criticism from the other side of the Atlantic, with Clinton warning that the United States might go to the World Trade Organisation or impose sanctions.\nEuropean antitrust lawyers had said the commission might rule the merger illegal in its current form, leaving the door open for Boeing to change the agreement and resubmit it for approval in Europe.\n","classes":[13,25,26,40,44,80,87,88,90],"classes_pad":null}

The ferry was on its way to Alaska on Tuesday.\nAlaska Senator Frank Murkowski hinted at retaliation for the incident on Monday. Canada's Anderson has acknowledged that the Americans could harm Canadian ferry routes by prohibiting access through U.S. waters close to Vancouver.\nCanadians fear bitterness from the salmon dispute could spread over into trade issues where Canada is vulnerable.\n\"They can always hurt us more than we can hurt them,\" said political scientist Edelgard Mahant at York University in Toronto. \"So we have to make an effort to negotiate at the senior level in Washington.\"\nThe ferry blockade came amid a long-running dispute over salmon quotas.\nLate last week, the Canadian government sent the United States a diplomatic note accusing it of violating an international treaty late last week.

The ferry is now free,\" Anderson told CBC radio on Tuesday morning. \"They have a very serious concern...but the blockade was not helping.\"\nAfter recent reports that Alaska fishermen were catching more than six times their normal salmon harvest this year, Canada accused the United States of overfishing and violating a treaty. The United States denied the charges but frustration has mounted in British Columbia fishing communities.\nThe U.S. State Department on Monday condemned the blockade and urged the Canadian government to enforce a court order compelling the fishermen to free the ferry. Tensions rose over the weekend after the fishermen burned an American flag and shouted obscenities at the ferry.\nThe key to ending the blockade was a promise by Anderson to ask his government to bear financial liability for any damages from the siege. The fishermen fear Alaska will seek to hold them responsible for the costs.\nThe minister also promised to explore compensating fishermen who have seen their incomes plummet because of the dispute and to investigate their complaints.\nDespite vowing to work for a solution to the crisis, Anderson stressed the problem was difficult. \"We cannot resolve this in one day,\" he said.\nBut Bob Rezansoff, a spokesman for the vessel owners, said the fishermen believed their protest was successful. \"They have a sense of accomplishment, of bringing the issue to the attention of the public all over,\" he told the Canadian Press news service.\nAfter years of squabbling, Canada and the United States currently have no further negotiations scheduled on the salmon dispute.

At June 30 cash totaled US$230 million, shareholders' equity was US$3.6 billion, the debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.12 to 1, and none of the debt was due for 10 years.\n((Reuters Toronto Bureau (416) 941-8100))\n","classes":[15,18,44],"classes_pad":null}

VocalTec will provide ITXC with technology and software products.\nITXC, stands for \"Internet telephony exchange carrier\" a reference to the company's hybrid strategy of combining Internet telephony with interexchange, or long-distance phone services.\nAt AT&T, Evslin had served as vice president in charge of WorldNet Service since its inception last year.  \nThe Internet access service had about 923,000 subscribers at the end of June, the company said.\nEvslin will remain in charge of WorldNet until a successor is named.\nITXC plans to provide Internet phone service providers routing and settlement services, similar to those that already exist in the traditional phone industry.\nThe departure of a top-level AT&T executive to form an Internet phone start-up suggests that the emerging technology has rounded a corner and is gaining acceptance within the mainstream phone industry.  \n\"The founding of ITXC is a watershed event in the ongoing convergence of the Internet, telephony, and computing markets,\" said Elon Ganor, the chief executive of VocalTec.\n\"ITXC will provide services for (Internet Telephone Service Providers) that are crucial to the development of a unified multimedia communications network spanning the public, switched telephone network and the Internet,\" he said.\nWhile Evslin's move does not necessarily mean an end to his ties with AT&T, he joins an exodus of executives from AT&T over the last year that has highlighted the phone giant's predicament over attracting and keeping top-level managers.\n\"This illustrates that for those who have an entrepreneurial itch, you can't scratch it at AT&T,\" said Jeffrey Kagan, an industry analyst who runs Kagan Telecom Associates in Atlanta, in reaction to Evslin's move.\nThis is not a negative reflection on AT&T, but it suggests the problem the company faces retaining executive talent, he added.\nLast week, John Walter, AT&T's president and chief operating officer, resigned after the company's board declined to elevate him to become chief executive according to a timetable originally laid out when he was hired in October.\nOther top executives to depart in the last year include former president Alex Mandl, who left to take the top job at Teligent Inc., a wireless communications company, and Joe Nacchio, former head of consumer long distance at AT&T, who joined Qwest Communications International Inc a fiber-optic network service company.\n((-- Eric Auchard, New York newsdesk, 212-859-1712))\n","classes":[11,41,42,44],"classes_pad":null}

Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said they hoped to present a tax cut proposal to the Clinton administration Tuesday or early Wednesday.\nOn one key issue, the Republicans said they had agreed to retain the proposed indexing of the capital gains tax cut to account for inflation. President Clinton has threatened to veto any tax bill that contains tax indexing.\nAt the same time, White House officials said the president may speak out on the budget Tuesday, urging lawmakers to stick to the agreement to balance the budget by 2002 and pass a tax cut bill he can sign into law.\n\"We'd like to get this done and we'd like to sign a bill, but the president's not going to sign a bad bill,\" one official who asked not to be identified said. The administration believes its tax cut proposal is better targeted to the middle-class while the Republican plan better aids the wealthy.\nThe lawmakers met into the evening but agreed another session will be needed Tuesday morning to sort out differences before they can meet with White House officials.\n\"We understand where their (administration) hot spots are and we're trying to make sure they understand ours,\" Lott of Mississippi said before the evening meeting.\nHouse Ways and Means Committee chairman Bill Archer said he was unable to discuss details of their tax plans. \"We made a lot of decisions today. We've got a few more to make, but we made a lot of progress,\" the Texas Republican said.\n\"I think we are going to have a bill that can be supported by the Republican majority in the House and the Senate and one that can be signed by the president,\" he said.\nCongressional tax negotiators met with administration officials over the weekend in an attempt to move forward on the tax bill. However, they did not resolve any key issues.\n\"We lost an opportunity over the weekend to make progress, and I feel very disappointed about that,\" Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said.\n\"So over the last couple of days there has been no movement. And it increases my pessimism about our ability to ... finish our work this week,\" he added.\nSpeaking in mid-morning Lott offered a different assessment. \"I think we're making really good progress,\" he said. \"Tom needs to cheer up.\"\nLott added that he was still aiming to finish work on the tax bill before the August congressional recess. The tax legislation would implement the part of the May budget agreement between congressional leaders and the White House calling for $85 billion in net tax cuts.\nThe chairman of the House-Senate tax conferees urged all parties in the tax negotiations to show flexibility, citing his own proposal to scale back on a key priority.\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, a Delaware Republican, said he continued to \"strongly urge that all parties involved must be flexible.\"\nRoth said he had shown flexibility by offering to scale back proposals to expand Individual Retirement Accounts.\n\"If we are to come up with a tax relief bill that can pass the House and Senate and be signed by President Clinton, I would hope that others would be willing to show the same kind of flexibility,\" he said in a statement.\n","classes":[55,56,70,90,104],"classes_pad":null}

It also projected $3.21 for the year.\nThe company, hich makes pharmaceutical, health care and confectionery products, reported a profit of $0.85 per share for the second quarter on sales of $1.97 billion, compared to $0.79 on $1.79 billion for the same period last year.\nIt said sales growth during the period was driven by the U.S. launch of drugs Lipitor and Rezulin in the first quarter. The first is an agent that helps lower cholesterol, while the latter is a type two diabetes drug.  \nWarner-Lambert said global pharmaceutical sales rose 34 percent total $825 million in the second quarter. U.S. sales for those products were up 65 percent to $461 million and seven percent higher at $364 million in foreign markets.\nIt said sales growth in pharmaceuticals was driven by the two drugs and a anticonvulsant called Neurontin. Lipitor had worldwide sales of $151 million, while Rezulin had $79 million, it added.\nThe company said its consumer health care products had $675 million in global sales in the second quarter, five percent lower than the same quarter a year ago. U.S. sales in product were four percent down at $342 million and down five percent to $333 million abroad, it added.\n\"Second quarter segment results reflect the change in accounting for the product Zovirax,\" it said, explaining how the drug was no longer included in consolidated worldwide sales as a result of the 1996 restructuring of a joint venture deal with Glaxo Wellcome.\nWarner-Lambert said confectionery sales reached $467 million, \"slightly ahead of last year's quarter\". U.S. sales rose five percent to $145 million and foreign sales fell two percent at $322 million, it said.\n\"This performance is attributable primarily to Japan, where sales declined due to overall weakness in the gum and mint categories, intense competition and the decreased value of the yen,\" it said.\n","classes":[15,18,44],"classes_pad":null}

The company attributed the gains to higher volume and gross margins, and a continued shift in sales to more profitable premium brands.\nIt said its Marlboro brand of cigarettes now has a 34.6 percent share of industry sales, up 3.2 percentage points over the same period in 1996.\nInternational tobacco revenues rose 10.5 percent to $6.7 billion, on higher volume and margins. The gains were partially offset by the stronger dollar, mainly against key European currencies and the Japanese yen.  \nRevenues from North American food operations increased to $4.3 billion in the second quarter from $4.2 billion last year, led by strong results within the Kraft Foods North America unit, Philip Morris said.\nVolume for Maxwell House and other coffee brands declined during the quarter due to very heavy first-quarter buying in advance of commodity-driven price increases, and lower coffee consumption.\nInternational food revenues fell 3.6 percent to $2.6 billion, due primarily to the impact of currency.\nPhilip Morris said its second quarter beer revenues were up slightly to $1.2 billion.\n\"Our domestic tobacco business is performing well, our international tobacco business is forging ahead, and our North American food operations are turning in stellar results,\" said Geoffrey Bible, Philip Morris chairman and chief executive, in a written statement.\n","classes":[15,16,44],"classes_pad":null}

Earnings per share for the comparable quarter of $0.35 assumes postdemerger debt levels, normal corporate expenses and the exclusion of one-time items.\nCapital spending for the first six months of 1997 was down 52 percent to $74 million from $153 million in the comparable period.\nThe company also said it expects operating rates in its polyethylene unit to decline slightly in the fourth quarter as well as into 1998, which could result in lower profits for the segment at the end of calendar year 1997 and the beginning of 1998.\nThe company said a tight supply of U.S. ethylene, reflecting a combination of unplanned outages and and scheduled turnarounds, will be offset by a new capacity later this year.\n","classes":[15,16,44],"classes_pad":null}

It said new bottler Empresas Polar has added capacity and has accelerated re-entry into the market.  \nIn snack foods, PepsiCo said North American profits grew 11 percent due to margin enhancement and volume growth.  It cited strong growth in Tostitos and Doritos.\nInternationally, the snack business posted an 11 percent increase in sales and operating profit growth of 12 percent. Volume gains were led by Sabritas, PepsiCo's Mexican snack business, and by Brazilian snack company Elma Chips.\nThe company said its worldwide restaurant business posted a solid second quarter.

{"codes":["M11","MCAT"],"headline":"Wall Street seen steady at open, awaits Greenspan.","text":"\nWall Street is expected to open steady to slightly firmer on Tuesday, as both stock and bond markets bided time until a key speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan later in the day.\nThe Fed chief's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to the U.S. Congress, which starts at 1400 EDT\/1800 GMT, will take center stage in markets while investors digested earnings from major companies like International Business Machines Corp, analysts said.  \n\"All eyes are focused on the Greenspan testimony and earnings reports which are coming out,\" Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments, said. \"We have results from IBM, which is a little soft in Europe, but the main focus is on Treasury markets and Greenspan's comments.\"\nGreenspan will deliver the mandatory semi-annual testimony on the economy and monetary policy before Congress on both Tuesday and Wednesday.\nBonds and stocks were waiting on what Greenspan would say about inflation and the stock valuations, analysts said.  \n\"The market is looking to see if he says anything about inflation risk having diminished since March,\" Pierre Ellis, senior economist at Primark Decision Economics, said.\nEllis said Greenspan would not try to knock down the stock market, but that markets might end up with the impression he felt the share prices were too high.\nCardillo said Greenspan would probably not discuss the stock market, but would reiterate that the Federal Reserve would be vigilant about combatting signs of inflation.  \nMost stocks should trade in a narrow range ahead of the testimony, but shares of IBM could see profit-taking after the technology company posted second quarter earnings of $1.46 per share compared to $1.26 a share post-split in last year's second quarter, analysts said.\nResults were slightly better than Wall Street estimates of $1.42 per share, but the stock had risen ahead of the results results and could weaken now, Cardillo said.\n\"The stock went up in anticipation of the results, so it might be a 'buy the rumor, sell the news' scenerio,\" he said.  \nCardillo said IBM's declines might be short-lived and would probably not drag down the whole tech sector.\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 futures index was up 2.55 points at 920.20. The long bond rose 5\/32 to yield 6.53 percent.\nThe dollar hovered in a narrow range against the yen in Tokyo, trading at around 116.12\/17 yen. In Europe, the dollar extended gains against the mark, trading at 1.8125\/30 marks.\nThe mark was weak amid ongoing concerns about Europe's plans for economic and monetary union.\nJapan's Nikkei average closed down 92.30 points, or 0.46 percent, at 20,157.02.  \nIn London, the FTSE 100 was up 20.7 at 4826.4.\nU.S. stocks were mixed in London trading.\nThe Wall Street Journal said in its Heard on the Street column that performance by money managers on average still trails the performance of the Standard & Poor's 500 index.\nThe New York Times said in its Market Place column that First Union Corp, which plans to buy Signet Banking Corp for about $3.25 billion, might be paying a reasonable price by some measures.\n((Wall Street desk 212-859-1730))\n","classes":[114,123],"classes_pad":null}

Rumors circulated in the market that the index fell 0.8 percent in the week ended July 19.\nAt 1455 EDT, Redbook Research's weekly retail sales data are due.\nTraders said reaction should be muted due to Greenspan's speech, which is seen shaping the market's near-term monetary policy expectations.\nAt February's installment, Greenspan used his testimony to hint at the Fed's rate hike in late March.  \nThe general consensus is that the Fed chief will give a balanced assesment of the economy -- not too sober, not too euphoric.\nMarket reaction to the testimony depends on which way he tilts, traders said.\nShould Greenspan suggest the Fed will keep rates steady for the time being, the market will most likely do much better, players said. But a hint at higher rates at some point could spook the market, although any selling is seen brief.\nAhead of the testimony, investors overseas nibbled at the market during the night in both Tokyo and London, buying mainly in intermediates, traders said.\nIn early morning trading, the outstanding two-year note was at 100-5\/32, up 1\/32, to yield 5.91 percent.\nFive-year notes were up 2\/32 to 100-12\/32, yielding 6.16 and 10-year notes were up 3\/32 to 102-23\/32, yielding 6.25 percent.\n(( -- Steven Scheer, N.A.

This offer was accepted by 98% of the shares resulting in the issuance of 3,336,433 shares of common stock. Generally accepted accounting principles require a non-cash charge to reduce Net Earnings Applicable to Common Shares in the calculation of EPS for the fair value of the securities issued in excess of the existing rate of approximately 1.185 common shares.\n(2) During the second quarter of 1997, the Company acquired all rights to its line of miniature vehicles, playsets and accessories marketed under the Micro Machines brand.  The agreement ends all litigation between the Company and the licensor over past royalties claimed by the licensor and the extent of the licensors rights in Micro Machines.  The Company has accounted for this agreement by taking a pre-tax charge in the amount of $22,949,000 in the second quarter of 1997 and $4,462,000 pre-tax has been classified as other assets and is being amortized over future periods. (3) Other selling and administrative expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 1996 were reduced by $2.3 million received in settlement of a claim for damages.  This benefit was partially offset by $1.3 million of unusual legal expenses incurred during the quarter related to this claim and another lawsuit where the Company is also the plaintiff.

But Northwest fell short of its year-ago results, struggling with the extra burden of a weak Japanese yen, which hurt business in its key Asia-Pacific market.\n\"They were slightly ahead of the official consensus, but in the range of expectations after American\" Airlines' posted better-than-expected second-quarter earnings last week,\" said Tom Schreier, an airline analyst with CS First Boston. American is a unit of AMR Corp.\nUnited, the nation's largest carrier, said continued cost-cutting efforts and strength in its Atlantic and Latin American markets offset weakness in domestic operations caused by the ticket tax.\n\"The reinstatement of the 10 percent ticket tax made this a particularly difficult quarter to produce year-over-year improvements in unit revenue and fully distributed earnings per share,\" UAL Chairman Gerald Greenwald said.\nThe passenger excise tax was not in place during last year's second quarter, which gave the industry a windfall of funds that normally go to the Federal Aviation Administration.\nUAL posted second-quarter pro forma fully distributed earnings of $376 million, or $2.82 a share, which topped Wall Street expectations and last year's $2.52 a share. Revenues were $4.38 billion.\nA year earlier, UAL earned $307 million on revenues of $4.16 billion.\nDomestic yield was flat in all markets, except Denver, where yield fell 6 percent from last year. Load factors also were lower in most domestic markets, the airline said.\nUnited also said it expects the third quarter to echo results in the second quarter, with international results \"quite strong\" and domestic results down slightly due to the ticket tax.\nFor the full year, United said it expects earnings on a fully distributed basis to modestly exceed the current analyst consensus estimate of $9.26 a share as reported by First Call.\nSeparately, United Airlines said it may resolve within the next two weeks its debate with the pilots union over which pilots will fly new regional jets the company wants to buy.\nThe talks with the pilots union have been a sticking point in United's plan to add regional jets that would feed its hub operations and bolster service to smaller markets.\nNorthwest also said the reimposition of taxes on airline tickets weakened results. The weak Japanese yen also offset gains in the carrier's U.S. passenger and cargo business.\n\"Northwest was pretty much in line, but they have a tougher revenue and cost structure and are heavily exposed to the yen. They beat expectations, but it's not a spectacular number,\" said Jeff Long, an airline analyst with J.P. Morgan.\nNorthwest Airlines posted second-quarter earnings of $136.2 million, or $1.26 a share, compared with $202.8 million, or $1.90 a share, a year ago. Operating revenues were essentially flat at $2.55 billion compared to $2.54 billion a year ago.\n\"Our results reflect a strong domestic performance, which largely offset the estimated $80 million impact of the reimposition of the ticket tax during the second quarter,\" said Northwest President John Dasburg. \"Our Pacific business was soft and significantly impacted by a weaker yen year-over-year,\" he said.\nThe strengthening of the yen during the second quarter created non-cash charges of about $30 million in unrealized losses on yen-hedging agreements and exchange losses on net yen-denominated liabilities, Northwest said.\nNorthwest's second-quarter cargo traffic was flat, but cargo revenues rose 5.3 percent on the strength of higher yields.\nUAL stock was up $1 at $77.50 in consolidated late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\nNorthwest stock was up 50 cents at $36.50 on Nasdaq.\n","classes":[15,16,44],"classes_pad":null}

Nizar Hamdoon insisted there were no problems in implementing the aid distribution plan Baghdad says must be finalised before it will restart exports due to have commenced on June 9.\n\"I'm confident. Everybody needs money, so I don't foresee any problems,\" said Hamdoon.\nBut he added the review of the aid plan, formally submitted on Monday, will last at least through this weekend. Western diplomats had predicted it taking a week for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to agree the deal.\nThe sales, designed to relieve the sufferings of civilians under sanctions, should net Baghdad $2 billion every six months for food and medicine, but Iraq complains aid disbursement has been slow.\nOnce the hand-out plan is settled, price formulae for the oil must be submitted to the United Nations and contracts agreed with buyers, a process that could take at least another two weeks.\nIraqi worries and supply disruptions in the North Sea have provided a cushion for oil prices, stopping benchmark Brent blend from sinking below $18 a barrel. The price has fallen by 25 percent this year.\nAt 1545 GMT September futures contracts for world benchmark Brent blend crude were up 13 cents at $18.22 a barrel, while in New York front-month West Texas Intermediate was up 11 cents at $19.29 a barrel.\nTraders are divided on how badly prices will be hit when Iraqi sales do resume, with some suggesting the bad news has already been factored in, and others saying the potentially huge volume will severely depress values.\nIraq has to sell $1 billion of oil in two 90 day periods, and has been told it can carry over only five percent's worth, forcing it to at least double previous export volumes in August to hit its cash target.\nIn the short-term oil prices have been helped by the strength of gasoline in the United States, where a key blending component in reformulated gasoline, methyl tertiary butyl ether, has shot up in price.\nDealers said there may also be some anticipation in the market of a bullish draw in crude and gasoline stocks in this week's U.S. industry stock data, due out tonight, after production disruption caused by Hurricane Danny.\n\t   Crude oil prices in dollars per barrel:\n\t\t\t\t\tJuly 22   July 21\n\t\t\t\t\t(1515GMT) (close)\n    Dated Brent\t\t   $18.46    $18.27\n    IPE September\t\t $18.22    $18.09\n    NYMEX August light crude  $19.28    $19.20\n-- Sean Maguire, London newsroom, +44 171 542 8060\n","classes":[119,122,123],"classes_pad":null}

He added that he had discussed the issue with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright by telephone on Monday and European Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan.\nIt was not immediately clear whether the Commission would have time to reconsult a committee of national antitrust experts on new Boeing proposals to avert a ban.\nThe climate on the two sides of the Atlantic has become very confrontational over the merger, with the U.S. Congress mounting a political and trade battle and French President Jacques Chirac claiming the merger is \"extremely dangerous\".\nBoeing's latest proposals came as a surprise, after the two sides broke off talks last week. Boeing's executive vice-president Richard Albrecht has been in Brussels since Friday.\nAsked earlier on Tuesday if Boeing still had a chance to win a reprieve despite the short deadline, an EU source said, \"In 24 hours you can do a lot of things, but you can't disregard legal procedures.\"\nHe said it would be difficult for Van Miert to reverse his plan to ban the merger before Wednesday since he would have to draft a new text and send it to senior Commission officials and the EU national antitrust experts for review.\nThe Commission believes the deal would strengthen Boeing's already dominant position in the commercial sector, a conclusion rejected by the manufacturer, which argues McDonnell Douglas no longer constitutes a serious competitor.\nMcDonnell Douglas's strength in the military sector also causes the Commission to fear that Boeing would benefit from defence funds to subsidise its commercial programmes.\nBut the most contentious point remains the exclusive supply contracts signed with large U.S. airlines American Aitlines, Continental and Delta.\nThe U.S. giant proposed last week to reduce the contracts to 13 years from 25 years and committed itself not to sign any new ones in the next 10 years, but the Commission thought this was not enough, EU sources said.\nThe Commission's determination to block the merger has triggered a barrage of sharp criticism on the other side of the Atlantic and Clinton warned the United States might go to the World Trade Organisaton or impose sanctions if this happened.\nThe EU executive has the power to block the deal if it finds it would harm fair competition in the 15-nation bloc. Were Boeing to go ahead with the merger regardless, it could impose fines up to 10 percent of the companies' turnover.\nThe final decision  rests with the Commission which must rule by a simple majority.\nSome European antitrust lawyers have speculated that the Commission may decide that the merger cannot be allowed in its present form, leaving the door open for Boeing to refile a modified agreement at a later stage.\n","classes":[13,25,26,38,40,44,80,82,87,90],"classes_pad":null}

Operating losses from films had been expected to continue.\nFirst-half group sales climbed five percent to 4.53 billion guilders with music generating sales of 3.94 billion. Operating profit in music rose to 522 million guilders from 457 million during the half.\nThe film division saw first-half turnover dip to 589 million guilders from 681 million with operating losses widening to 92 million from 37 million.\nFilm's second-quarter operating loss was 37 million guilders compared to 55 million in the first quarter and 18 million in the second quarter of 1996.\nChief executive Alain Levy said the strategy at the film unit was on track to deliver break-even over the next two years.\n\"Film strategy is on target. We always said 1997 would be a year of transition. There's nothing there to worry about,\" he said. \"We say 1998-99 for operating profit from film,\" he said reiterating a previous PolyGram forecast.\nPolyGram said the results of its filmed entertainment business reflected the division's lighter release schedule during the first six months of 1997, adding the division expected its strongest releases in the second half.\nThe Dutch company, 75-percent owned by Philips Electronics NV , has recently released \"Bean\", starring Rowan Atkinson, to enthusiastic audiences in Australia and the Netherlands. It plans to release mainstream movie \"The Game\", starring Michael Douglas, in September.\nFilm during the first half of 1996 benefited from the success of \"Dead Man Walking\", \"Fargo\", and \"Mr Holland's Opus\".\nAt the first-quarter stage in April PolyGram said underperformance of previously released films \"Portrait of a Lady\" and \"Gridlock'd\" had hit its earnings.\nPolyGram said the combination of sales from established artists such as U2 and the Bee Gees, along with those from breakthrough artists such as Hanson had delivered results in the first half.\n\"Despite challenging conditions in some of our markets, PolyGram's expertise in breaking new acts and promoting established artists is reflected in the first half results,\" Levy said in a statement with results.\nU2 sold over five million copies of their album \"Pop\" in the first half, while the Bee Gees sold 2.3 million albums. Newcomers Hanson -- decades younger than the Bee Gee trio of brothers -- sold three million copies of their album \"Middle of Nowhere\" in the second quarter.\nIn total nine albums sold over one million copies in the first half, compared to 15 in the first six months of 1996 when PolyGram released a bigger number of superstar albums.\nTotal unit sales for the top five albums in the first half of 1997 was 15 million compared to 13 million for the comparable period in 1996.\nAnalysts said the company's performance was broadly as they expected, although the film side had been a little disappointing.\n\"It (the film operation) is loss-making and will remain so for the time being.

Operating losses at film had been expected to continue.\nFirst-half group sales climbed five percent to 4.53 billion guilders with music generating sales of 3.94 billion. Operating profit in music rose to 522 million guilders from 457 million during the half.\nThe film division saw first-half turnover dip to 589 million guilders from 681 million with operating losses widening to 92 million from 37 million.\nFilm's second-quarter operating loss was 37 million guilders compared to 55 million in the first quarter and 18 million in the second quarter of 1996.\nPolyGram said the results of its filmed entertainment business reflected the division's lighter release schedule during the first six months of 1997, adding the division expected its strongest releases in the second half.\nThe Dutch company, 75-percent owned by Philips Electronics NV , has recently released \"Bean\", starring Rowan Atkinson, to enthusiastic audiences in Australia and the Netherlands. It plans to release mainstream movie \"The Game\", starring Michael Douglas, in September.\nFilm during the first half of 1996 benefited from the success of \"Dead Man Walking\", \"Fargo\", and \"Mr Holland's Opus\".\nAt the first-quarter stage in April PolyGram said underperformance of previously released films \"Portrait of a Lady\" and \"Gridlock'd\" had hit its earnings.\nPolyGram said the combination of sales from established artists such as U2 and the Bee Gees, along with those from breakthrough artists such as Hanson had delivered results in the first half.\n\"Despite challenging conditions in some of our markets, PolyGram's expertise in breaking new acts and promoting established artists is reflected in the first half results,\" PolyGram chief executive Alain Levy said in a statement.\nU2 sold over five million copies of their album \"Pop\" in the first half, while the Bee Gees sold 2.3 million albums. Newcomers Hanson -- decades younger than the Bee Gee trio of brothers -- sold three million copies of their album \"Middle of Nowhere\" in the second quarter.\nIn total nine albums sold over one million copies in the first half, compared to 15 in the first six months of 1996 when PolyGram released a bigger number of superstar albums.\nTotal unit sales for the top five albums in the first half of 1997 was 15 million compared to 13 million for the comparable period in 1996.\nAnalysts said the company's performance was broadly as they expected, although the film side had been a little disappointing.\n\"It (the film operation) is loss-making and will remain so for the time being.

{"codes":["GCAT","GHEA","GSCI"],"headline":"GENE RESEARCH KEY TO DIABETES CURE, EXPERTS SAY.","text":"\nGenetic research holds the key to any real advances in treating diabetes, experts told a conference on Tuesday.\nFinding the genes involved in diabetes can help doctors understand what exactly causes the disease -- they are still not sure -- and look for new drugs that will treat these causes.\nThere is also hope that gene therapy could eventually be used for at least some of the 135 million victims around the world. Scientists speaking at the 16th International Diabetes Federation Congress described the latest successful gene therapy experiments and efforts to track down diabetes genes.\n\"Genetic studies will be in a key role in determining what will happen in the treatment of type-two diabetes in the future,\" said Markku Laakso of the University of Kuopio in Finland.\nLaakso said scientists were hoping to discover a single major gene, responsible perhaps for 20 to 30 percent of all cases of type- two or non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM). That would offer a single target for a drug for NIDDM, responsible for about 90 percent of cases of diabetes.\nThe trouble is that at least four different genes have been identified that are involved in diabetes, a complex disease that results from both genetic susceptibility and outside factors.\nPhilippe Froguel of France's national research institute INSERM in Paris said not only are multiple genes involved, but an assortment of mutations are, too.\nIn some diseases just one or two mutations of a single gene are involved -- as in some types of breast cancer.\nBut Froguel said studies of 200 French families showed 70 different mutations of just one gene involved in diabetes.\nFroguel said new loci, or possible locations for genes involved in diabetes, were being discovered all the time. \"In the last month, at least three NIDDM loci were mapped,\" he told delegates to the congress on Tuesday.\nOnce the genes are found, scientists can look for the substances they cause cells to produce. Then drugs can be found that duplicate those effects -- or block them, if they are harmful.\nPossibly more amenable to a genetic approach is type-one or insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM), caused by the immune system mistakenly destroying the beta-cells in the pancreas that produce insulin.\nSavio Woo, director of the Institute of Gene Therapy at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, told the congress his team had seen recent successes in IDDM gene therapy attempts.\nThey used rats, killing off the beta cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. This caused diabetes in the animals.\nWoo's group then genetically engineered a retrovirus -- which injects its genetic material into target cells -- to carry a rat insulin gene.\nBecause the rats had no pancreatic beta cells, Woo targeted the liver. His hope was that the rat's liver cells could be re-coded to produce insulin.\nIt worked.\nRats not treated died within days, while those who got the genes lived three weeks -- eventually succumbing to kidney failure from the drug used to kill their beta cells. New experiments are under way with rats specially bred to genetically develop diabetes.\nWoo said liver cells die very slowly, and those that divided would carry the new gene with them, so the effects would be long- lasting. \"One injection would last for many years,\" he said.\nBut there were dangers. The gene therapy could work too well, causing hypoglycaemia, or dangerously low blood sugar levels. A way would be needed to turn it off.\nWoo also said diabetes was too complicated a disease to treat as a whole by gene therapy. If the goal was regulating people's blood sugar levels \"that's too much to ask for,\" he said.\n\"If we aim too high from the beginning that will make it am impossible task,\" he added.\n\"But if your goal is to target it to a group of patients who have trouble with insulin injections or complete insulin deficiency, then there are applications.\" REUTER\n","classes":[90,99,107],"classes_pad":null}

The bill will be covered by broadcasting rights, sponsorship and ticket sales. The Greek state will undertake costs involved with technical infrastructure, already included in state programming.\n--Nationals of European Union member-states will be able to apply for positions in the Greek public service as of the beginning of next year, according to a presidential decree being drafted after years of delays. \n--The upward trend in interbank market interest rates are the reason behind Citibank and Xiosbank's announcements on Monday to increase rates for lending and deposit accounts respectively. \n--The government reaffirmed on Monday that it planned to freeze tariffs for most public utilities in 1998 as part of the effort to contain inflation, sources said. Also under consideration are measures to contain extra state spending, through the stricter implementation of lending criteria.\nIMERISIA\n--Tuesday will see critical meetings for the state and future of the economy as Prime Minister Costas Simitis meets National Economy and Finance Minister Yannos Papandoniou, economics professor Yiannis Spraos, president of the state-run Hellenic Telecommunications Organisation and development minister in succession. Papandoniou is expected to outline the basic directions of incomes and taxation policy for 1998 in his meeting with Simitis. \n--The European Commission has decided not to withdraw its suit against Greece regarding taxes on imported secondhand cars despite efforts by Athens to present new measures as a resolution of the problem.\n--SEV, the federation of Greek industries, has developed seven proposals to the government regarding its revision of development laws. SEV said it agreed with the institution of tax incentives and subsidised interest rates but that subsidies should not be done away with entirely.\nKERDOS\n--Liquidity in the interbank market continues to be limited, resulting in interest rates remaining at high levels despite a marginal reduction. \n--The government reportedly discussed the emphasis it wants to place on an upgrading of quality of services in the public sector at meetings on Monday, pledging that as of September a new relationship between customers and public organisations and enterprises would be introduced. \n--Conditions in money markets are putting pressure on lending interest rates, given the higher cost of money for banks attributed to high rates on the interbank market and limited liquidity.\nNAFTEMBORIKI\n--Sources of revenues for the coming year - estimated at one trillion drachmas - will be examined at Tuesday's meeting between Papandoniou and Simitis. Changes to the tax scale and an increase in the tax-free threshold are also on the table for discussion.\n--The Greek economy will receive a positive jolt if Athens is chosen to host the 2004 Olympic Games, organisers of the 2004 bid said on Monday.\nEXPRESS\n--Profits of an Athens 2004 Olympic Games would come to 37 million dollars, according to the organisers. \n--A consortium made up of Enterprise Oil, Union Texas and MOL will sign contracts on Tuesday with Greek state-run DEP-EKY to drill for possible oil reserves in western Greece. --Maria Petrakis, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4\n","classes":[90],"classes_pad":null}

LATE REPORT\nSterling leapt above 3.04 marks for the first time in more than six-and-a-half years, drawing strength, along with the dollar, from expectations that a broad European economic and monetary union will be launched in 1999.\nConcern that the EMU entry criteria will be diluted has intensified amid signs that France's 1997 budget deficit will be above the goal of three percent of gross domestic product.\nGerman comments, including those made on Tuesday by Finance Minister Theo Waigel, have been viewed by traders as an indication of tolerance of this overshoot. This fanned talk that countries like Italy will join EMU from the outset.\n\"When people ask how low the mark can sink, the answer seems to be quite low,\" said Philippa Malmgren, European currency strategist at Bankers Trust. \"This reflects the euro's lack of credibility and given that everyone expects EMU to happen on time, no-one wants to own marks.\"\nSterling hit 3.0440 marks, the strongest it has been since October 1990. It was last at 3.0385\/95 marks at 1422 GMT against 3.0153\/58 late Monday in Europe.\nThe dollar also gained against the mark, rising to a 71-month high of 1.8145, leaving cable little changed at $1.6760\/70 from $1.6768\/78 yesterday.\nWaigel tried to inject a note of caution into the prevailing mood of mark bearishness by saying Germany was in contact with other countries about foreign exchange matters. Traders were not perturbed, though.\n\"There is nothing to stop the mark from weakening further unless the Germans back up verbal intervention with something more effective,\" said Keith Lewis, manager of treasury markets at American Express Bank.\nThe UK monetary authorities would be quite happy to see the pound at lower levels given the pain its strength is inflicting on UK exporters.\nSterling's trade-weighted index has surged 25 percent in less than a year and is now at 105.9, its highest since August 1990, the base year for the index.\nUK Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown told a parliamentary committee on Tuesday he wanted a stable and competitive pound. His comments failed to puncture sterling's rally against the mark, though, as he did not specify how this goal could be achieved, analysts said.\nSterling bulls are, moreover, banking on economic fundamentals going their way and expect to get a bigger premium for holding pounds rather than marks in the months ahead.\n\"The UK's economic fundamentals are strong and all the risks for growth are on the upside,\" said Ian Morris, international economist at HSBC James Capel. \"This will be very good for the pound in the short term.\"\nThe rate-rise expectations on which sterling's rally has been based may have been overdone, the International Monetary Fund warned in its annual review of the UK economy.\nIt said UK rates may not need to rise as far as the market was expecting to keep inflation in check. The IMF also said the pound's surge was unsustainable and that it would prove short-lived.\nWhile short sterling contracts rallied on the report, currency traders largely shrugged it off.\n\"The reading is that rates are still going to have to go up,\" said Martin de Blocq, sales manager at Nomura.\nThe December short sterling contract was last up three basis points at 92.60. That still implies rates will rise to 7.40 percent by end-1997 from the 6.75 percent they are at currently.\n-- Swaha Pattanaik, London newsroom +44 171 542 6284\n","classes":[116,118,123],"classes_pad":null}

But the minority party was delighted it could finally influence policy in areas where it has often led, and Labour has followed.\n\"This is the real beginning for a different style of politics in Britain,\" Ashdown told a news conference.\nUnder Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system, power has traditionally been won by a single party that then governs alone for up to five years until the next election.\nThe May 1 election was a triumph both for Labour, which won the largest victory in its history, and for the centre-left Liberal Democrats, who almost doubled their representation in parliament to 46 seats.\nAn aide to Blair said establishing the committee of six senior ministers and five Liberals, which will probably meet once a month, marked the prime minister's desire to create a new politics in Britain by reaching out to like-minded parties.\n\"The question we have been asked since the election is How will you influence what is going on given the government's massive majority?'\" Ashdown said. \"Now you have the answer.\"\nBut the opposition Conservatives said the agreement deprived the Liberals of the right to be regarded as opponents of Blair.\n\"Mr Ashdown's deal today makes it clear there is only one major party now in Britain that is engaging in constructive opposition to this government, and that is the Conservative Party,\" said education and employment spokesman Stephen Dorrell.\nLabour officials acknowledged one of the aims of the panel was to bind the Liberal Democrats closer to Labour in case the ruling party ever needed their parliamentary support. \"We won't have a 179 majority for ever,\" one said.\nTop of the agenda for the committee will be issues such as devolution of power to Scotland, Wales and English regions, possible introduction of proportional representation for the House of Commons, and reform of the House of Lords.\nAshdown said progress on these issues, which had already been discussed between the two parties before the election, was \"the long-held wish and dream of the Liberal Democrats\". But Labour has only recently shown an interest in them.\nSubsequent topics for the committee may include relations with the rest of Europe, and the peace process in Northern Ireland.\nThe last time the third party had a big influence on policy was in the late 1970s when Labour formed a pact with the Liberal Party -- the forerunner of the Liberal Democrats -- to stay in office after losing its parliamentary majority.\n","classes":[90,104],"classes_pad":null}

It affects the healthy social and economic development of all societies.\"\nBellamy described the annual document as a report card of nations on their performance on issues affecting the health, welfare and rights of children. It offers a compilation of statistics on each country's progress towards reaching goals for basic human needs.\nThe report detailed progress in some areas, including a decrease in mortality rates among children under five and an increase in availability of safe water supplies, but it made grim reading on the conditions faced by women and children.\nIt noted that between 25 and 50 percent of all women have been physically abused by their intimate partners. Up to 130 million women and girls in the world today have had their genitals removed in a ritual practice that is common in at least 28 countries.\nMore than one million children, mostly girls and mainly in Asia, are forced into prostitution every year, and in India more than 5,000 women are killed because their in-laws consider their dowries inadequate.\nUNICEF said the forms of violence against women and children are both subtle and blatant but violence's impact on development is profound.\n\"It is so deeply embedded in cultures around the world that it is almost invisible,\" the report said.\nBellamy told the news conference that the key to improving the condition of women and children throughout the world was education, the impowerment of women and legal protection.\nOut of the 193 nations in the world, just 44 have enacted legislation against domestic violence, only 27 have laws against sexual harassment and just 17 regard marital rape as a crime.\nIn 12 Latin American countries a rapist can be exonerated if his victim agrees to marry him. Son preference is so prevalent in some countries that genetic testing for sex-selection, although outlawed, has become a booming business.\nBellamny urged governments to read the report and to do something about the conditions in their own countries and to increase aid to help other nations.\n\"There is such a great deal to be done,\" she said. \"It (the report) is a call on the nations of the world to respond.\"\n","classes":[90,91],"classes_pad":null}

A smaller party, the UK Unionists, withdrew from the talks on Monday.\nPaisley denounced Blair's government for its readiness to negotiate with \"IRA\/Sinn Fein terrorists\". The IRA declared a ceasefire at the weekend to earn a seat for Sinn Fein when the main talks get underway in September.\nPaisley said: \"The fact is that IRA\/Sinn Fein has bombed its way to the negotiating table, and nothing less than the empty chairs of the Unionists at that table will demonstrate the rejection of this ... act of betrayal.\"\nThe present peace process should be scrapped,\" he said.\nNorthern Irish Protestants have expressed scepticism at the IRA (Irish Republican Army) ceasefire declared on Sunday because it makes no reference to a permanent truce in its 28-year struggle against British rule.\nThe last ceasefire, declared in August 1994, was broken 17 months later when the IRA exploded a huge bomb in London's Docklands area, killing two people.\nLeaders of the Orange Order, an influential organisation in the Protestant community, threw the peace process further into doubt on Monday when they called on all unionist parties to pull out of the talks at Stormont Castle in Belfast at once.\n","classes":[90,93,104,110],"classes_pad":null}

These figures were stated on a proforma basis, as the company is changing its year end to April 30 from end December.\nSales rose to 2.28 billion pounds from 2.26 billion. There was an exceptional charge of 19 million pounds to cover the withdrawal from businesses in Russia and India, offset by a 16 million gain from property sales.\nLast month, Littlewoods abandoned plans to sell its entire chain of shops, saying it would dispose of only selected sites.\nIt announced last week the sale of 19 shops to rival Marks and Spencer Plc for 192.5 million pounds.\nChairman James Ross defended the decision to stick with the stores and said profits since the year end were ahead, although sales were down by about 10 percent.\nRoss said the Littlewoods' board had looked at a whole array of offers for its shops, including some for the entire 135 strong chain, but had decided a sale would not maximise value for shareholders in the privately held group.\n\"We have definitely decided not to sell the stores (division) in its entirety because to do so would have been to destroy substantial value in the process,\" he told Reuters in an interview.\nReports in the British press on Monday suggested some Littlewoods' shareholders were unhappy with the M&S deal, which will mean redundancies of between 1,700 and 1,800.\nThe articles pointed to a 540 million pound offer for Littlewoods 135 shops from venture capital firm CVC Partners, which they said was still on the table. But Littlewoods responded saying that CVC had not made a clean cash offer that would have allowed the group to exit the retailing business.\nWhen asked about the press reports and the offer from CVC, Ross said, the board had tested the market and decided not to sell. He said the board had performed the normal job of any board to manage the process and make a recommendation to shareholders.\n\"No board of either a private or a quoted company...goes with all the details of every offer that is made to the shareholders and says please tell us what to do.\"\nHe said all the 32 Moores family members had signed up to a shareholder charter last April, which separated shareholder and board responsibilities.\nThis aimed to put an end to past squabbles over the direction of the group, which two years ago included the possible sale of the entire company.\nShareholders will vote on the sale to M&S at a meeting in September, he said.\nRoss said Littlewoods would sell up to five more of its shops, leaving it with around 110 stores. These would focus on the 45-plus age group and be scaled down to between 10,000 and 15,000 square feet. Excess space could then be leased to provide income to underpin profitability.\nThe stores have fallen behind in the scramble for sales in British town centres. Ross acknowledged that the value of sales per square foot at rivals such as M&S was three times that of Littlewoods.\nThe group's football pools division has also had a rough ride since the introduction of Britain's National Lottery. Operating profit fell to 21.2 million pounds last year, from 24.1 million.\nThe pools were relaunched last autumn, but the new mid-week lottery had been another blow, Ross said.\nHe said the group had cut costs to the bone, and now had to drive income forward. \"Our aim is to stabilise the situation,\" he said.\nHome shopping, the firm's biggest division, increased operating profit to 61.7 million pounds from 58.2 million.\nLittlewoods is waiting to hear the outcome of a monopoly enquiry into its plans to buy Freemans mail order from Sears Plc, which would give it about 25 percent of Britain's agency home shopping market.\nRoss said he believed Littlewoods had won the intellectual arguments on the investigation, but this did not guarantee a green light from the government.\nHe said the group was putting greater emphasis on fast growing direct mail via its Index Extra catalogue. He said the group would experiment with smaller branded catalogues, possibly with its own Berketex brand.\nThe company also announced the appointment of Barry Gibson as chief executive from September.\n($ = 0.597 British Pounds) --London Newsroom + 44 171 542 7717\n","classes":[15,16,17,25,26,27,44],"classes_pad":null}

Everyone is just waiting for Greenspan,\" said a senior dealer at a London stock brokerage.\nMarkets are fairly confident that Greenspan will not drop any bombshells when he addresses the House of Representatives banking sub-committee on Tuesday and the Senate banking committee on Wednesday.\nU.S. inflation seems to be well under control despite a strong economy, meaning interest rates should remain stable for the time being.\nBut Greenspan can always surprise, as he did last December when he warned investors on Wall Street against irrational exuberance. The comment sent stock markets around the globe tumbling, but not for long.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 16.26 points to 7,906.72 on Monday -- 26 percent higher than its close on December 16, the low point after the Greenspan comments.\nGreenspan could make markets jittery if he said strong economic growth could put upward pressure on prices and interest rates later in the year. This would hurt stocks and bonds, but it would support the already strong dollar.\n\"Maybe he will make reference to the exuberance in stocks that he referred to last December, since when the (U.S.) market has gained 25 percent, and he may talk about the outlook for stronger growth,\" said one senior stock dealer in London. \"But ... providing he's not too severe then the markets will probably be OK.\"\nNotwithstanding the Greenspan jitters, European stock markets took heart from Wall Street's firmer close on Monday after two sessions of heavy profit-taking.\nBy midday London's FTSE-100 index, which tumbled 143 points in the past two sessions, was up 23.1 points or 0.48 percent at 4,828.8.\nGermany excelled with the DAX index surging 123.13 points or 3.0 percent to 4,231.53. Dealers said that the dollar's rise to around 1.81 marks, a level not seen since 1991, boosted stocks of exporters.\nBanks also jumped after Monday's news that two of Germany's largest commercial banks, Bayerische Vereinsbank AG and Bayerische Hypobank, would merge.\nThis encouraged hopes of a consolidation in the banking industry. Commerzbank AG led the way, gaining 6.40 marks or 11.4 percent to 62.50.\nWall Street and the dollar also helped the Paris bourse, which shrugged off Monday's announcement of company tax rises. Investors took a positive view, saying they would help France to qualify for European monetary union by cutting the state deficit closer to the qualifying target.\nThe CAC-40 was was up 36.68 points or 1.28 percent at 2,910.80 by the early afternoon.\nThe foreign exchange markets were also waiting for Greenspan, but the dollar still strode to a 71-month high against the mark. \"What we saw really was mark weakness rather than anything particularly on the dollar,\" said Robert Hayward, an analyst at Bank America.\nDealers said worries that the single European currency would have a large number of founder members and would be weak continued to weigh on the mark. This was fuelled by Monday's announcement of French tax rises and spending cuts which are expected to cut the 1997 budget deficit to around 3.2 percent of GDP, just above the 3.0 percent EMU target.\n\"The French measures were expected but they provide more ammunition for the market's stubborn belief the euro will be a weaker currency,\" said a German bank dealer.\nThe dollar hit 1.8115 marks but volume was low as the market awaited Greenspan.

{"codes":["E51","E511","E512","ECAT"],"headline":"OPINION-L'Afrique-C'est Chic - By J.Graham-Maw.","text":"\nBy James Graham-Maw, global portfolio manager at Foreign and Colonial Emerging Markets Ltd\nLONDON, July 22 - Africa accounts for 11.3 percent of all developing country exports and 8.6 percent of developing country GDP. Its average central government budget deficit is forecast to fall to the Maastricht-friendly level of just 1.5 percent this year. The IMF estimates that Africa will enjoy six percent GDP growth and single digit inflation in 1998.\nReaders can be forgiven for raising an eyebrow at these numbers. Africa gets a terrible press - shameless kleptocrats and horror viruses provide editors with much better copy than structural adjustment facilities and free market orthodoxy.\nEmerging market investors are fond of saying that tomorrow's economies are being built in today's capital markets. It is clear that the outlook for tomorrow's Africa has changed: prices and exchange rates have been liberalised, governments are actively reducing their control over their economies, and these are in turn becoming increasingly equity-financed rather than debt-burdened. This change was driven, inter alia, by the end of the Cold War. The withdrawal of the agents of the U.S. and USSR left a money vacuum into which fiscally-strapped and compassion-fatigued Western governments and aid agencies have been reluctant to remit. Official flows still account for nearly 10 percent of the continent's GDP but this figure is falling steadily. The message is blunt: reform or perish.\nAfrican governments have learnt that private sector capital has an extremely wide choice of deficits to fund and that in the new world order they must compete for it.\nAFRICA'S 'LOST CENTURY'\nAt the end of the nineteenth century the average British fund manager had 10 percent of his portfolio in African assets. The figure is now a fraction of one percent. We speak of the 1980s as Latin America's lost decade; Africa has effectively missed out on most of the twentieth century.\nIt still has significant disadvantages to address. Firstly its economies are undiversified: primary production - principally mining and agriculture - represents over one-third of the continent's GDP. There is a bullish case for commodities - rarely heard in today's low inflation environment - to the effect that many fast-growing economies, particularly in Asia, are now entering the commodity-intensive phase of their development.\nHowever, Africa's rainfall patterns are unpredictable and cause huge swings in agricultural output from year to year. Its over-reliance on mineral resource wealth also has some negative implications; mining interests in developing economies tend to be paternalistic and prone to cronyism.\nAlthough there are honourable exceptions such as Botswana, this can concentrate economic power into very few hands and short-circuit the establishment of a reform-minded middle class. On the micro level, mining concerns are price-takers, not price setters (again diamonds, a non-fungible commodity, are an exception) and are therefore manifestly not in control of their own destiny. Furthermore EVA analysis adds weight to the suspicion that mining companies are, at best, only modest creators of shareholder value. They do not set an ideal example in a young emerging market.\nAfrica has other challenges to face. Its low rates of urbanisation hamper the flows of information, goods and services which would boost growth. Only Cairo, Jo'burg and Lagos qualify as bulge-bracket cities. The average urbanisation rate of Africa's investable countries is less than 40 percent compared with Mexico's 75 percent.\nAFRICA FDI FLOWS PALTRY\nForeign direct investment (FDI) flows into Africa are picking up, but from an extremely low base, and remain paltry by emerging markets standards. Africa attracted less than five percent of all FDI flows into emerging markets last year, with Morocco and South Africa accounting for the bulk of the investments.\nIt may be too early in the life-cycles of most of these markets to worry whether they are getting the 'right kind of money' (ie. cold rather than hot). However, one can think of only few areas (horticulture, tourism) where Africa has a natural competitive advantage. Africa's domestic savings rate is 15 percent, half the level which drove the growth of the Asian tigers, against an average investment rate of 19 percent. This leaves a financing gap of four percent of GDP, which expands to nine percent if South Africa is excluded and the average is weighted.\nFurthermore, Africa continues to suffer from poor, though improving human capital resources. Its average adult literacy rate is in the region of 65 percent, well below the rates in excess of 80 percent in Latin America, Asia and Eastern Europe. Although economists tend to focus on mechanistic methods of physical capital accumulation ('hardware'), it is becoming clear that human 'software' has an increasing role to play in the information age.\nAfrica's low rates of urbanisation and literacy also impede participation in the political process and hence democratic normalisation. European and Asian models show that pressure for democracy is usually a result, not a cause, of economic development: democratisation has historically been driven by the intelligentsia born from the wealth of newly emergent economic agents who spur development of the economic base and crystallise the nation state. Africa, criss-crossed with the colonial legacy of irrational borders, has witnessed the ascendance of ethnicity over nationality: clan loyalties are fiercest.\nIn South Africa, apartheid policy has fed on this, and diluted black anger by fomenting tribal rivalries. However, although violent upheavals continue in Central Africa and Islamic fundamentalism confronts several countries in the north, there is room for some optimism in African politics. In a study commissioned by Flemings, the UK Foreign Office Africa Research Group estimates that as at June 1997, 39 of 53 African countries now enjoy freely-elected government. Although South Africa has its fair share of economic and social problems, its political transformation leads the continent by example. In the words of one specialist portfolio manager, Africa has swapped Marx for Mandela.\nAfrica's unhappy image has meant that in some cases its competition for capital has been pursued with an even greater rigour than one could hope for, and a few of the countries mentioned in this article will go on to become emerging market stars of the future. The African markets, especially those of the 'lion-cub' economies of sub-Sahara, exhibit low correlations with other emerging markets and also with each other.\nThese are true emerging markets, and dance to the tune of their own fundamentals rather than that of the U.S. long bond.  \nRISK DIVERSIFIER\nFrom a Modern Portfolio Theory standpoint they thus offer the investor risk diversification. However, in the near term it is much more likely that an investor will consider African assets as a potential earnings enhancer than a risk diversifier. We need to consider whether the momentum of structural change is faster than the change in investors' attitudes: does Africa represent a classic perception\/reality arbitrage opportunity? Sustainable macro-economic policies reduce the rate at which investors discount future micro-cash flows. Combine this fundamental justification for multiple expansion with growing corporate profitability and the return of flight capital and we will see a full-blooded re-emergence of the continent.\nIndeed, the past few years have witnessed a palpable revival in interest in Africa. It now boasts several dedicated funds and two indices investing in and tracking its markets. Straplines such as 'Africa - the last frontier' across investment circulars suggest a new emerging market vogue is upon us. The total market capitalisation of Africa stock markets (excluding dual listings) has more than doubled from $131 billion in 1989 to $289 billion in 1996. This figure is distorted by South Africa, which, in terms of market capitalisation to GDP, has one of the most developed equity markets in the world.\nHowever, there is strong evidence of a rise in equity culture elsewhere in Africa too - the assets under management of the Moroccan mutual fund industry, for example, have grown over seven-fold over the past 18 months. If we strip out South Africa, therefore, Africa's progress has been even more dramatic, with market capitalisation rising from $6 billion in 1989 to $47 billion in 1996.\nIt is not within the scope of this article to do full analytical justice to each of Africa's 15 stockmarkets, but some points can be made. Inevitably, the closer one looks the more varied the picture.\nPAINFUL ADJUSTMENT\nFinancial sector liberalisation has led to positive real interest rates becoming established in all these African countries with the exceptions of Malawi, Nigeria and occasionally Zimbabwe. This has reversed the pattern of negative real interest rates and mis-allocation of credit which hindered the development of the banking sector. In the short term these high real rates can be painful.\nIn Accra recently I asked the head of the stock exchange how much of his net worth was in Ghanaian equities. He sheepishly replied that with T-Bills at 47 percent and inflation at 30 percent he'd rather buy debt than equity. The Kenyan market is also straining under the weight of 10 percent-plus real rates and a heavy-handed political regime, but would offer considerable growth and value if the forthcoming election were to clear the air and the authorities lift the 40 percent ceiling on foreign ownership.\nUganda is to open a stockmarket later this year and has announced a large inaugural privatisation which should draw attention to its stunning economic renaissance in recent years. Tanzania seems to be thinking along the same lines and the outlook for the 70 million-strong East African community is bright. Zambia has at last started to tackle its problems and is in the early stages of a powerful turnaround. Mauritius and Botswana are the only two African countries from the select band of economies worldwide (14 in all) which managed to register real GDP growth in excess of five percent every year between 1985 and 1995.\nBotswana is a pragmatically run, no-nonsense place in which to invest. Although its fabulous diamond wealth might constitute a structural impediment to diversifying its economy, it has tied its naturally appreciating currency (the pula) to a naturally depreciating one (the rand) in an attempt to stimulate its manufacturing base.\nMauritius has sensibly diversified over the years from sugar to textiles to shipping, and as a natural intermediary between Anglophone and Francophone Africa and the subcontinent of India, is now moving into financial services. If its new government does the right things, the limelight beckons. The Cote D'Ivoire is another highly attractive macro story but Abidjan needs to overcome its characteristically French mefiance of its bourse if it is to develop into a meaningful regional capital market for Francophone West Africa.\nNearby Nigeria is an economic giant in African terms, and with 130 million consumers has critical mass as an emerging market already. Investors will be watching the country closely as the timetable for its transition to democracy nears, but the military government's previous record in this respect is not encouraging.\nEven further out on the fringes in Africa's pre-equity markets, intrepid debt traders have been looking at ways of valuing $235 billion of African Paris Club debt outstanding. Debt-for-equity swaps may eventually provide a market solution to this problem, but the prices of Sudanese debt (over seven cents on the dollar) and Zairian paper (13 cents) have begun to rise already.\nHowever, in the words of former World Bank vice-president Kim Jaycox, \"Holding a revolution is not a qualification for debt relief.\"\n\t\t\t    \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/\n(The opinions expressed in this article represent those of the author only.

Furthermore, coffee-drinking takes a seasonal dip during northern hemisphere summer.\n\"In general, there's no shortage of robustas around,\" said one London-based market analyst. \"The rise in retail prices is not helping demand either. As such the price fall is not unexpected.\"\nBy Tuesday midsession, the London futures for robusta beans, widely used in soluble and instant blends, fell $50 to $1,497 per tonne basis September after breaching the closely-watched $1,500 support level.\nThis was the lowest since late January. The market had peaked at 20-month high of $2,700 in late May.\nIn 1994 frosts and then a drought in Brazil caused prices to quadruple to $4,140 per tonne.\nThe New York market, mainly supplied from the Americas, rose to the highest level in 20 years of $3.18 per lb basis July 1997 delivery. On Tuesday, the September delivery stood at $1.63, up slightly from $1.58 on Monday.\nBrazil's coffee districts have escaped frost so far this season. And no freezing temperatures were forecast through the end of July, the traditional end to the frost season.\n\"Seasonally, the market should also be making a bottom with lows typically seen by mid-July during non-freeze years,\" U.S. brokerage Merrill Lynch said in a recent report.\nThe dazzling price rally had encouraged heavy sales by producers, with exports reaching a hefty 81.8 million 60-kg bags in the 12 months to end-May.\n\"Roasters now appear to have a comfortable physical coverage through the next winter roasting period,\" UK trade house E D & F Man said in a recent report.\nStocks in consumer hands stood at 10.90 million bags at the end of May, up from 9.90 million a month earlier and 9.10 million a year earlier, Man said.\nAmong robusta-producing nations, supplies from Ivory Coast and Vietnam are said to be fairly sizeable. But output from Indonesia, the world's biggest robusta producer, is expected to drop by a third on adverse weather.\n","classes":[119,120,123],"classes_pad":null}

This fanned talk that countries like Italy will join EMU from the outset.\n\"When people ask how low the mark can sink, the answer seems to be quite low,\" said Philippa Malmgren, European currency strategist at Bankers Trust. \"This reflects the euro's lack of credibility and given that everyone expects EMU to happen on time, no-one wants to own marks.\"\nSterling hit 3.0440 marks, the strongest it has been since October 1990. It was last at 3.0385\/95 marks at 1422 GMT against 3.0153\/58 late Monday in Europe.\nThe dollar also gained against the mark, rising to a 71-month high of 1.8145, leaving cable little changed at $1.6760\/70 from $1.6768\/78 yesterday.  \nWaigel tried to inject a note of caution into the prevailing mood of mark bearishness by saying Germany was in contact with other countries about foreign exchange matters. Traders were not perturbed, though.\n\"There is nothing to stop the mark from weakening further unless the Germans back up verbal intervention with something more effective,\" said Keith Lewis, manager of treasury markets at American Express Bank.\nThe UK monetary authorities would be quite happy to see the pound at lower levels given the pain its strength is inflicting on UK exporters.  \nSterling's trade-weighted index has surged 25 percent in less than a year and is now at 105.9, its highest since August 1990, the base year for the index.\nUK Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown told a parliamentary committee on Tuesday he wanted a stable and competitive pound. His comments failed to puncture sterling's rally against the mark, though, as he did not specify how this goal could be achieved, analysts said.\nSterling bulls are, moreover, banking on economic fundamentals going their way and expect to get a bigger premium for holding pounds rather than marks in the months ahead.\n\"The UK's economic fundamentals are strong and all the risks for growth are on the upside,\" said Ian Morris, international economist at HSBC James Capel. \"This will be very good for the pound in the short term.\"\nThe rate-rise expectations on which sterling's rally has been based may have been overdone, the International Monetary Fund warned in its annual review of the UK economy.\nIt said UK rates may not need to rise as far as the market was expecting to keep inflation in check. The IMF also said the pound's surge was unsustainable and that it would prove short-lived.\nWhile short sterling contracts rallied on the report, currency traders largely shrugged it off.\n\"The reading is that rates are still going to have to go up,\" said Martin de Blocq, sales manager at Nomura.\nThe December short sterling contract was last up three basis points at 92.60. That still implies rates will rise to 7.40 percent by end-1997 from the 6.75 percent they are at currently.\n-- Swaha Pattanaik, London newsroom +44 171 542 6284\n","classes":[116,118,123],"classes_pad":null}

Brown, in his first appearance as Chancellor of the Exchequer before the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee, said the IMF report was an endorsement of his efforts to end \"short-termism\" which had bedevilled Britain for decades and put in place long-term policies to boost prosperity.\n\"I am pleased that the IMF has endorsed our approach today, not simply because they have endorsed my budget judgment but because they have endorsed an approach that is based on the long term, commending in turn our policies for long-term stability, investment, employment and fairness,\" he said.\nHe faced tough questioning from opposition Conservative members of the committee, who challenged him to admit that his budget had done virtually nothing to curb consumption.\n\"It is quite absurd to say there is no effect on consumption,\" he told the committee, adding that measures such as reducing tax relief on mortgage interest payments and increasing stamp duty on the purchase of expensive homes would take around one billion pounds ($1.7 billion) out of consumers' pockets next year.\nCommittee members also made clear their concerns about the damaging effect which the strong pound, which has risen more than 25 percent against major currencies in the last year, is having on industry.\n\"I did say in the budget that I appreciated the worries of exporters and of industry about the pound,\" Brown said.\n\"My aim is a stable and competitive pound over the medium term. But I do say to you what worries industry most of all is the threat of a return to the stop-go economics of the past. I am determined that should not happen.\"\nSterling firmed to a peak of 3.0438 marks on Tuesday, its highest level since October 1990, before slipping back.\nBrown said the five-year deficit-reduction plan announced in his first budget on July 2 would reduce the need for interest rate increases in the medium term.

All the key drivers are doing very well.\"  \nKleinwort Benson's Stephen Putnam added that \"really the results were bang in line with expectations and don't change the view that it is the safest of the three big (UK) companies.\"\nAnalysts were pleased with the 15 percent gain in drug sales in the quarter, which was slightly ahead of some expectations. Strong growth in the U.S market was a major factor in the gains, which were through volume rather than price.\nAnti-depressant Paxil, which competes with Eli Lilly & Co's Prozac, saw sales rise 33 percent at comparable exchange rates to 211 million stg, putting it just behind SmithKline's biggest-selling drug, anti-biotic Augmenin, which had sales totalling 215 million stg.\n\"Paxil is the great engine of growth,\" said Putnam. \"That was the best decision they have ever made to license that in.\"\nSocGen's Diggle said however that Augmentin, which the company itself predicted would be overtaken by Paxil this year, \"refuses to lie down,\" with a 17 percent rise in sales in the quarter. Diggle was also pleased with the performance of Hepatitis B vaccine Engerix B, which saw sales rise by 14 percent at constant exchange rates.  \nThere was some concern about continued strong cash outflow at the company, although analysts said much of this reflected continued investment in research and development, particularly the costs of developing a clutch of late-stage products, and supporting over-the-counter ones.\nR&D spending rose by 18 percent in the second quarter.\nPutnam said Kleinwort Benson was likely to continue its stance of recommending switching from Glaxo Wellcome Plc into SmithKline.\nHe said there were concerns about Zeneca Group Plc's longer-term pipeline of new drugs, while Glaxo was promising two years of flat earnings.\n\"Zeneca looks the cheapest, but SmithKline is the safest. With Glaxo you are paying a lot for two years of boring profits in the hope there will be a big turnaround,\" Putnam said.\n-- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717\n","classes":[15,16,18,44],"classes_pad":null}

While the Dutch have reformed their labour markets, Germany and France are treading carefully for fear of causing social unrest, and hampering EMU.\nGermany's fragile centre-right coalition lacks the power to push through major reform measures, and the new French socialist government, grappling with 12.5 percent unemployment, is wary of the whole idea.\n\"The trouble is that France in particular, and Germany to a lesser extent, don't accept the labour flexibility model,\" said Adrian Schmidt, senior international economist at Chase here.\nThe German Finance Minister Theo Waigel has said euro hopefuls should focus on reducing structural unemployment without committing new funds.\nBut French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin is boxed in by election promises to create jobs and has already agreed to raise France's minimum wage -- a move economists scorn.\nAt a summit in Amsterdam in June France secured a European resolution emphasising the importance of jobs, but the details have not been worked out.\nAlthough French wages are not as high as those in Germany, the labour market is more rigid and the public sector, shielded from competition, weighs more heavily on the budget, analysts said.\nGermany has made some strides. Companies are already undercutting high wages that thrive on state-backed contracts, and working hours are expected to be reduced.\n\"The wage cartel that we had in Germany for a long time is breaking down,\" said Fels.\nBut a stumbling block is the welfare sector where the government will struggle to overhaul high social benefits and pension payments, economists say. One bright spot is Italy, where Prime Minister Romano Prodi's government, desperate to join the euro in the first wave, has embarked on plans to reform the state pension scheme. With a rapidly ageing population, pension expenditure in Italy -- the biggest in Europe at some 62 percent of the total welfare bill -- is forecast to rise to unsustainable levels unless significant reforms are implemented.\nOverall continental European labour has lagged behind the United States, whose flexible job markets set a model for the rest of the world, and Britain, where nearly two decades of right-wing rule emasculated labour unions and encouraged mobility.\nBoth the U.S. and British economies are growing at a healthy speed while the rest of Europe is crawling.\nTHE WRONG DIAGNOSIS?\nNot all economists subscribe to the view that Europe's unemployment is structural. Some argue that the double blow of debt and unemployment is symptomatic of recession, and labour flexibility cannot cure it alone.\n\"The idea in Europe that unemployment is structural is very weak and I don't believe it,\" said Chris Allsopp, lecturer in economics at New College, Oxford.\n\"If you're going to get rid of the twin crises you need really to raise the European growth rate by 0.5 to 1.0 percent a year over the next decade,\" he said.\nThat in itself is a formidable task, but Allsopp said the solution was a careful blend of fiscal consolidation, monetary softening, and a weak exchange rate.\nOthers say that while growth can help stem further job losses, it will be insufficient to take those who are already unemployed off the dole.\n","classes":[46,62,70,80,84,90,100],"classes_pad":null}

{"codes":["C18","C181","CCAT"],"headline":"German insurers gain power from bank merger.","text":"\nWith the merger of Bayerische Hypo-Bank and Bayerische Vereinsbank, insurer Allianz and reinsurer Munich Re have once again played a decisive role in reshaping the German financial services sector\nTogether with the state government of Bavaria, they made sure that a \"Bavarian solution\" was found which reinforces Munich's role as one of Germany's financial centres. The two insurers would have been no more keen than Bavaria's governors to further strengthen Frankfurt's role.\nThe insurance giants gain other benefits from the deal. After the merger, Allianz will hold 15.9 percent of the new bank, and Munich Re 7.45 percent. While this does not give them control, it does make them the two largest shareholders and therefore bestows considerable influence.\n\"The improved strategic positioning of the new bank leads to a clear increase of the value of our stake, which is in the interest of insurers and shareholders,\" said Allianz CEO Dr. Henning Schulte-Noelle.\nAllianz also feels positive about the technical side of the merger, which it helped to engineer: Vereinsbank will offer Allianz shares to Hypobank shareholders, one Allianz for six Hypo. The nine billion marks ($5 billion) worth of shares, accounting for some nine percent of Allianz's capital, have so far been held by Vereinsbank. They now increase the number of Allianz shares on the open market, without diluting the share.\nFor Allianz and Munich Re, a major attraction of the merger is a strengthening of their banking sales channels and the chance to build on existing relationships.\nAllianz is already cooperating on a regional level with Hypo-Bank, of which it owns 22 percent. Dusseldorf-based Victoria Versicherung, over which Munich Re is just about to gain control and which will be a core company of its new Ergo primary insurance group, has long-standing ties with Bayerische Vereinsbank.\nBoth Munich Re and Allianz also cooperate with Dresdner Bank: Munich Re subsidiary Hamburg-Mannheimer has a sales agreement with Dresdner, as has Allianz. Allianz owns 22 percent and Munich Re two percent of Dresdner. Those hoping for a breakup of the close relationship between Allianz and Dresdner after the Munich merger may be in for a disappointment.\nBut joint sales channels are not the only reason for banks and insurers to seek closer ties. The German insurance industry currently invests 470 billion marks - around 40 percent of its total investment portfolio - as fixed-interest loans and bonds with banks. Insurers are therefore one of the largest sources of refinancing for the banks.\nWhile rival insurers Axa Colonia and Aachen Munich are bidding for a share of Postbank to jump onto the Allfinanz train, the market leaders have managed to create their own banking group while keeping existing ties with Dresdner.\nAs one analyst said: \"Three weeks after the Ergo merger announcement, the Munich insurance powerhouse is again displaying its command of the situation.\"\nInsurer Aachen Munich's cooperation with the BfG Bank has not been quite as successfull so far, but the real question on the lips of industry observers is how Deutsche Bank will react.\n\"It was a suitor for Vereinsbank and bought five percent last year. By now, Deutsche must feel threatened in its role as the leading force of the German financial services sector,\" the analyst said.

By 0900 GMT the September contract was up three basis points at 92.80, December was up three at 92.60 and March 1998 was up four at 92.52.\nThat implies three month money of 7.40 percent by year end, peaking at around 7.50 percent by the middle of 1998. With UK base rates currently at 6.75 percent, that would entail around another half point increase before the tip of the cycle.\n\"I think rates will have to go to 7.25 percent and the market is discounting between 7.25 and 7.50 percent -- so that's not excessive,\" said Scott.\nBut he added there was the possibility of a rebound at the short end later in the year, provided growth does not bound ahead out of control.\nIn its annual review of the British economy, the IMF praised the \"excellent start\" made by the new Labour government, and said it was difficult to criticise the scale of fiscal tightening in the July 2 budget.\nAnalysts noted the ball was firmly in the Bank of England's court as far as rate rises were concerned since the government gave it greater independence in May.\n\"The Bank of England is in an absolute bind,\" said Glenn Davies, chief UK economist at Credit Lyonnais in London.\n\"The bottom line is they're not going to move at the next (monetary committee) meeting on August 7 but there is the risk thereafter as they get more data suggesting consumer spending is very strong.\"\nAdam Cole, UK economist at HSBC James Capel, was much more pessimistic about both the short and the long end of the gilt curve.\n\"The IMF report was fairly glowing on the UK economy and as such the market can take encouragement from that -- but much of that was already on board,\" he said.\n\"If anything we think there are some upside risks to short sterling on a 12 month view on the basis domestic demand carries on powering ahead more quickly than people expect pushing interest rates further than expected,\" he added.\nCole predicted a near term peak in interest rates of 8.0 percent by the middle of 1998, implying further losses at the short end.\nAnd he was almost as gloomy at the long end, predicting gilt underperformance on a relatively bearish inflation forecast and bullish activity outlook.\n\"I'd look for that spread convergence to come back on track in late 1998 not 1997,\" said Cole. The upshot would be a significantly inverted yield curve next year, leaving investors well advised to plump for the short end, he added.\nBy 1050 GMT, the 10-year gilt\/Bund spread was at 159 basis points, making it one of Europe's highest yielders.\nScott was slightly more optimistic on spread narrowing, but added it would only be gradual.\n\"Certainly I think the longer term trend is a narrowing of gilts against Bunds -- but so many people have got that trade on already, it'll need another kick from somewhere,\" he said.\nScott was forecasting a gilt\/Bund spread of 115 basis points by year end.\n-- International Bonds Unit +44 171 542 8682\n","classes":[115,116,117,123],"classes_pad":null}

Sales, helped by acquisitions, leapt to 1.152 billion pounds from 501.2 million and the annual dividend was raised to nine pence from 6.7 pence.\nBrian Souter, executive chairman, described the results as \"excellent\", just months after the bus and railway company was dogged by criticism over disruptions at its South West Trains (SWT) rail franchise when it axed 10 percent of its drivers.\nStagecoach shares initially jumped on the news but later staged a sharp about turn, falling six pence to 731 after touching a high of 765.\nThe group came close to a one million pounds fine from rail watchdog Opraf over SWT and paid out 1.5 million in voluntary compensation to irate passengers who suffered hundreds of train cancellations.\nBut Stagecoach profits emerged unscathed, with the surge fuelled by its recent expansion spending spree.\n\"These are quality results from an increasingly quality company,\" said Nigel Hawkins, analyst at Yamaichi.\nRichard Hannah, analyst at UBS, said the results had topped his forecast of 112 million, citing rolling stock company Porterbrook as the catalyst for the dynamic profit growth.\nSouter said of the performance:\"These achievements reflect further developments in our core bus businesses in the UK and overseas; a first full- year contribution from SWT; the impact of the current year acquisitions of Porterbrook and Swebus (the Swedish bus company).\"\nProfits were further bolstered by 15.2 million pounds in proceeds from the sale of a stake in Strathclyde Buses.\nStagecoach said the current year had \"started well\" and that prospects looked good. Souter said he believed the group's expansion programme would deliver \"strong growth in earnings for the future\".\nSouter said its SWT unit was now back on track after its problems. He said the group's aim was \"to deliver consistent quality over the remaining six years of the franchise\" in the hope of getting an extension to its term to run the rail service.\nLooking to the year ahead, finance director Keith Cochrane said on the domestic bus front, growth would be organic. He ruled out major acquisitions in Britain, telling Reuters, \"UK bus acquisition prices at the moment are too high due to regulatory uncertainty.\"\nThe finance chief said Stagecoach would concentrate its ambitions on sealing a follow-up deal to Swebus in another continental European country.\nThe group's African bus businesses remained a worry, with Kenya hit by renewed political turmoil over demands for democratic elections and the Malawi business seeing margins suffer from \"unregulated competition\".\nCochrane told Reuters the Malawi operation was up for review and one option was to \"downsize the business to a profitable core and focus on intercity routes.\"\nLooking at a divisional breakdown of the results, continued British bus operations saw turnover up to 450.5 million, versus 388.3 million, with profits to 67.4 million from 58.3 million.\nAfrican bus operations saw turnover up to 37.3 million versus 34.0 million, with profits down to 3.3 million versus 4.5 million.\nNew Zealand turnover was 15.4 million, up from 14.8 million, but profits fell to 2.7 million from 3.5 million.\nSouth West Trains saw turnover up to 283.4 million versus 63.4 million -- reflecting the first full year of its inclusion. Profits were 8.0 million versus 400,000 pounds.\nThe newly acquired businesses, comprising mainly of Porterbrook and Swebus, provided turnover of 353.9 million and profits of 86.9 million.\nSince the end of the results period, Stagecoach concluded its acquisitions of Thames Transit Ltd and Docklands Transit Ltd for 8.2 million in cash , with a further one million linked to performance targets.\nIt has also finalised a 3.7 million pound acquisition of part of Transit Australia, a 120-strong bus operation in Queensland.

The mark has accordingly fallen against currencies outside the EMU project.  \n\"Sterling, the dollar, the Swiss franc and the Swedish krona are all benefiting from the talk about a weak euro,\" said Martin de Blocq, sales manager at Nomura.\nSterling climbed as high as 3.0285 marks, in line with the dollar's surge to a 71-month high of 1.8120 marks. The pound was at 3.02685\/95 marks at 1010 GMT against 3.0153\/58 late Monday in Europe. Cable was at $1.6715\/25 against $1.6768\/78 yesterday.\nExpectations that the UK will not join EMU from the outset are not the only reason for sterling's rally, though. Talk of higher UK rates have also helped push the pound higher against other major currencies in recent months.  \n\"The UK's economic fundamentals are strong and all the risks for growth are on the upside,\" said Ian Morris, international economist at HSBC James Capel. \"This will be very good for the pound in the short term.\"\nHe expects sterling to climb to a peak of 3.05 marks, extending the 16 percent gains it has already racked up against the mark so far this year.\nThe rate-rise expectations on which sterling's rally has been based may have been overdone, though, the International Monetary Fund warned today in its annual review of the UK economy.  \nIt said UK rates may not need to rise as far as the market was expecting to keep inflation in check. The IMF also said the pound's surge was unsustainable and that it would prove short-lived. While short sterling contracts rallied on the report, currency traders largely shrugged it off.\n\"The reading is that rates are still going to have to go up and the fundamentals are still good so sterling has a good bid tone to it,\" said de Blocq at Nomura.\nThe December short sterling contract was last up two basis points at 92.59. That still implies rates will rise to 7.41 percent by end-1997 from the 6.75 percent they are at currently.  \nExpectations that the UK monetary authorities are not about to act to halt sterling's rally has made traders bolder about driving the pound higher.\nSuch expectations were reinforced after Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown told a parliamentary committee he wanted a stable and competitive pound without specifying how this goal could be achieved, analysts said.\n-- Swaha Pattanaik, London newsroom +44 171 542 6284\n","classes":[116,118,123],"classes_pad":null}

We have worked very hard since May 1 to change opinion in the European Union.

This can coincide with the understandings of the second and third redeployments. Either we will deal with them separately or we'll succeed in reaching a final agreement before carrying out the redeployments,\" Netanyahu told reporters.\n\"If the Palestinian Authority wants to take the path of redeployments, we will take that path but each side will safeguard its interests on this path,\" he said.\n\"But I suggest that we concentrate our effort, our interests, our creativity on an overall agreement between us and the Palestinians. That is much better. It can provide both of us with what we want -- peace,\" he said.\nPalestinians question Netanyahu's commitment to the peace deals he inherited with his election last year. His right-wing government agreed to a redeployment in March that was only a fraction of what Palestinians expected under their peace deals.\nEarlier in the day Netanyahu and his National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon toured the northern West Bank while surveying what the prime minister's office said were security needs in the framework of a final status accord.\nUnder peace deals, Israel has agreed to withdraw troops from parts of the West Bank in two more redeployments and to negotiate a final status deal on such difficult issues as final borders, Jewish settlements and Jerusalem by May 1999.\nIsraeli-PLO talks have been stuck for the last four months since Netanyahu broke ground on a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.\nIsrael captured East Jerusalem in 1967 and claimed it as part of its undivided capital, a claim not recognised internationally.

Under this program, the state has a constitutional obligation to provide sufficient funds to make timely debt service payments on the bonds, if necessary. Moody's has also assigned a Aa3 underlying rating and stable outlook to the bonds based on well-managed financial operations resulting in sizable reserves, a favorable debt position, impressive wealth indices, and growing local economy. Specific credit characteristics are as follows:\nPrudent Management Results in Significantly Improved Financial Position.\nOfficials have successfully restored the district's earlier deteriorated financial position through prudent management of district resources and cost-saving measures. This recovery began in the early 1990s and has continued under Proposal A despite only minor increases in enrollment, a key indicator of the amount of state foundation monies a school district will receive. Consecutive years' surplus operations have augmented General Fund reserves, which in fiscal 1996 amounted to over 12% of General Fund revenues, slightly exceeding the district's minimum target of 10%. Unaudited fiscal 1997 results indicate a modest drawdown of the General Fund balance, the result of planned pay-as-you-go financing of capital projects. Officials are projecting generally balanced operations at fiscal year-end 1998. Moody's believes that the district's favorable financial position will likely continue given management's proven willingness and ability to manage district finances. Furthermore, although enrollment growth is expected to stabilize in the near-term, the district is enjoying modest increases, which enhance state revenues, without commensurate expenditure growth.\nFavorable Debt Position; No Borrowing to Come.\nAlthough this offering more than doubles the district's outstanding debt, debt burden remains below peer group medians, reflecting the district's sizable taxable resources. Debt per capita is high, with direct debt more than three times median amounts, however, the district's impressive wealth indices mitigate this concern. Moody's expects the district's debt structure to remain favorable given its expanding taxable values, above average principal amortization, and lack of future borrowing needs for at least ten years.\nSubstantial, Diverse and Growing Tax Base.\nThe district, totally contained within the City of Troy, is characterized by its substantial, diverse and growing tax base. Residential valuation accounts for only one-half of taxable values, and several regional and corporate headquarters, including the K-Mart Corporation, are located here. The city's sizable lodging sector is reflective of this corporate presence, while the development of a high retail base, including an impressive shopping mall, results from good road access and the proximity of affluent residential communities. Construction of upscale residences continue to accommodate an increasing population, yet enrollment has only moderately grown, most recently at about 2% annually. Officials attribute this to the attraction of an older, wealthier resident to the district. City unemployment rates are among the lowest in the state, at about 1.6%.

{"codes":["E21","E212","ECAT"],"headline":"San Miguel County Housing, Colo., BBB by Fitch.","text":"\nNEW YORK, July 22 - San Miguel County Housing Authority's (CO.) $190,000 5.90% collateralized notes, due July 1, 2004, $2.335 million 6.30% collateralized notes, due July 1, 2013, and $4.7 million 6.40% collateralized notes, due July 1, 2023, are affirmed at 'BBB' by Fitch, following its annual review.\nThe financing, which is secured by one multifamily property (Village Court Apartments) in Telluride Village, CO. closed Sept. 1, 1993. The affirmation reflects the strong debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of the transaction. DSCR has increased to 2.17 times (x) as of Dec. 31, 1996 from 1.66x as of June 30, 1993. DSCR calculations reflect total income (the sum of income from property operations and collection income from a local property assessment), and the maximum annual debt service payment required during the life of the deal. Average occupancy at the property was down in 1996, due to an increased supply of affordable housing units in the market over the past three years.\nIn an effort to boost occupancy, management has instituted a two-tier rental rate structure that offers shorter term leases that better meet the demands of Telluride's seasonal economy. The property continues to maintain occupancy greater than 90% during the ski and summer seasons. As a result of the decline in average occupancy, 1996 was the first year, since the transaction closed, that money from the local property assessment was used to help pay debt service. DSCR from property income alone was approximately 0.80x in 1996. However, this is not a concern because bondholders have the right of first refusal to the annual property assessment fund, which has increased from approximately $500,000 in 1992 to $900,000 in 1996. In addition, the transaction has further security in the form of a reserve fund sufficient to pay one year's debt service.

The White House has said it might support some form of means testing, but wanted changes.\nClinton opposes the other Medicare changes.\n\"The president's leadership is decisive on the ability to reform Medicare,\" Gingrich said. \"Senators felt strongly they wanted to go back to him again and urge him to actually offer leadership rather than being timid.\"\nWhite House health adviser Chris Jennings said the administration was trying to work out a compromise on Medicare premiums. He said time was running short.\nRepublicans are trying to reach consensus on $115 billion in five-year Medicare reductions, about $15 billion in Medicaid savings and other spending cuts needed to implement a five-year balanced budget deal with the White House.\nCongressional leaders want to pass a final budget bill, and a companion measure cutting taxes by $85 billion by Aug 1.\nRepublicans were designing a children's health plan that would give states broad latitude to design their own insurance programmes. They did not decide on the funding level.\nThe new children's health proposal would allow states to offer either direct services or health insurance to children. States would choose from a menu of insurance options.\nThe Senate had passed a plan requiring states to use the money for a specified benefits package, including vision, dental and mental health services.\nState governors opposed the Senate plan, asking for the broadest possible latitude to design their own programmes. The new proposal would let states to choose from a menu of insurance plans, providing less coverage than the Senate.\n\"The president would veto that bill, if you minimise the child health provision,\" Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota told reporters.\nAs part of their offer to the White House, Republicans took a hard line on restoring aid to hundreds of thousands of legal immigrants set to lose disability benefits this summer under a welfare law.\nRepublicans said they will not agree to a White House request, supported by the Senate, to guarantee aid to legal immigrants now in the country who become disabled in the future.\n\"It's a step backwards ... I don't think if they want to have it as leverage on the tax bill, it will work,\" said Michigan Democratic Representative Sander Levin.\n","classes":[55,56,70,90,99,104,113],"classes_pad":null}

The Marshal has custody of McDougal.\nThe suit alleged the government was subjecting McDougal to \"abusive and inhuman\" treatment to force her to cooperate with Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr in his probe of President Clinton.\nStarr is trying to determine if President Clinton used his influence as then governor of Arkansas to secure McDougal and her ex-husband James McDougal an illegal government loan.\nClinton and the McDougals were partners in the failed Whitewater real estate development.\nA spokeswoman for Starr denied that he had anything to do with McDougal's treatment in jail, but ACLU legal director Mark Rosenbaum disagreed.\nHe told a news conference: \"The treatment endured by Ms. McDougal since her incarceration in county facilities is the result of the most barbaric conduct by a federal prosecutor toward a resistant grand jury witness in the history of the republic.\n\"The modern day 'Starr Chamber' treatment she has experienced has been abusive and inhuman. It is degrading to the congressional purpose in setting up the institution of the special prosecutor.\"\nIn Washington, a Marshals offfice spokesman said the service \"was just carrying out the court's order. We put her wherever we're told and wherever there is space.\"\nMcDougal, 42, was ordered held in civil contempt for the life of the Whitewater Grand Jury in Little Rock, Ark., because she refused to cooperate with Starr's wide-ranging probe into Clinton's real estate dealings. The grand jury is expected to wrap up its work in mid-November.\nShe was called before the grand jury after being sentenced to 24 months in jail for her role in securing an illegal Small Business Administration loan. Her ex-husband is now cooperating with prosecutors but she has refused, saying Starr is waging a vendetta against Clinton and wants her to lie about the President.\nRosenbaum said that since McDougal was transferred from a federal prison in Texas to Los Angeles, where she faces separate embezzlement charges, she has been consistently placed in handcuffs, denied visitation rights, held in isolation in a glass cell for 23 hours a day and forced to wear a red uniform usually worn by baby-killers and informants. He added that McDougal's mother had to sue to get permission to visit her daughter.\nThe lawsuit said that on days when McDougal had to make a court appearance she was roused at 3:30 a.m., her hands shackled to a waist chain and then taken on a bus with abusive male prisoners. The men prisoners were said to have taunted her and exposed themselves to her.\nA spokeswoman for Starr said he had nothing to do with her treatment in the county jail and it was Starr's position that McDougal be treated like any other person held for civil contempt.\n","classes":[90,91,104],"classes_pad":null}

That pact, reached after months of negotiations, aims to eliminate the federal budget deficit by 2002 while cutting taxes.\nSome officials argued that a Clinton statement could offer some tactical advantage to White House negotiators, especially on the issue of taxes, where the administration believes its tax-cut proposals are better targeted to the middle class.\n\"We have a bill the American people support significantly more than they support the Republican alternatives, so we feel good about where we are,\" said one official. \"We'd like to get this done and we'd like to sign a bill, but the president's not going to sign a bad bill.\"\n\"We think we can both win an argument (on taxes) and we would also increase pressure on them to hold to the deal,\" said another official. \"We would press them publicly because it helps get a deal at the end of the day and we think it substantively (would be) a better deal.\"\nThe officials said that if Clinton speaks out, his remarks would essentially restate points he made in a letter sent over the weekend to the Republican chairmen of the congressional tax-writing committees and their ranking Democratic members.\nIn that letter, he argued that neither of the tax bills passed by the House and Senate \"provides an adequate share of tax relief to middle-income families.\"\nIt also said that both plans \"failed a critical test of fairness\" by denying the benefits of a proposed $500 per child tax credit to families that earn less than $30,000 per year.\n","classes":[55,56,70,90,104],"classes_pad":null}

They said they were smuggled from Mexico into southern California and transported to Los Angeles and to New York City.\nSeven people were arrested, four of whom were arraigned on Monday in federal court in Brooklyn. They were charged in a conspiracy to bring, transport and conceal illegal aliens.\nIf convicted, they each face a possible prison sentence of 10 years for each illegal alien involved.\nPolice in the United States and Mexico said they were searching for a Mexican man believed to be the leader of the operation, identified by police as Reinaldo Paoletti.\nFour of those arrested were members of the Paoletti family.\nArraigned were Alfredo Rastrian-Paoletti, 37; Rosa Beltran-Sanchez, 25; Santa Gonzalez, 21, and Jose Paoletti-Lemus, 28.\nAll but Rastrian-Paoletti are deaf.\nBeltran-Sanchez, who is five months pregnant, cried heavily throughout the proceedings, and Bruce McIntyre, attorney for her husband Paoletti-Lemus, said his client was \"more victim than victimiser.\"\nA bond hearing was scheduled for Aug. 4. Three others were arraigned on Sunday on state charges.\nIn Washington, Immigration and Naturalisation Service Commissioner Doris Meissner said the agency was deeply disturbed by the incident and would free up all necessary INS resources to aid the criminal probe into alien smuggling.\nMeissner said she spoke on Monday with U.S. Attorney Zachary Carter, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Mexican Ambassador Jesus Silva-Herzog to pledge the agency's full cooperation and support to \"aggressively prosecute those responsible for these horrendous violations of our laws.\"\nINS was considering options for custody of the victims in the New York City area once the New York police completed their investigation.\nAuthorities believe the ringleaders recruited their victims from homes and schools for the deaf and mute in Mexico, promising them a better life in the United States.\nThe victims said they were forced to work seven days a week as street peddlers, according to court documents.\nThey said they were forced to sleep on floors and were abused if they did not make enough money selling key chains, baseballs, pens and toys, the documents said.\nAuthorities said in one apartment they found $35,000, $10,000 of which was in one dollar bills.\nAll of the people found in the two apartments were illegal aliens, authorities said. Of the 57 rescued, 12 were children ranging in age from six months to 16 years.\nThe Mexicans were in the custody of city authorities and the American Red Cross was providing them with housing and food until their immigration status was determined.\nIn Washington, Secretary of Labour Alexis Herman said Labour Department officials and authorities with the Immigration and Naturalisation Service were investigating the case.\n\"I share the public's sense of outrage at the discovery that dozens of deaf Mexican immigrants in New York City were forced to live in the most squalid conditions and work for little or no pay,\" she said. \"We need to address the continuing problems of the underground economy, which operates in the shadows and so is more difficult to monitor.\"\n","classes":[90,91],"classes_pad":null}

A year earlier, the company earned $583 billion, or 36 cents a share, on sales of $7.7 billion.\nThe results were better than Wall Street's projections of 37 cents a share, based on estimates compiled by First Call. PepsiCo's stock climbed $1.875 to $37.50 a share in early composite New York Stock Exchange trading.\nThe results included a one-time gain of $135 million, or 2 cents a share, partly in connection with the company's sale of its restaurant distribution business.\nPepsi said North American soft drink sales were lower than expected due to cold weather and intense competition.\nSoft drink sales, as measured by shipments of cases from bottlers, grew 2 percent for the quarter, resulting in profit and sales that were about steady with year-ago levels, it said.\nHowever, an exception was the company's Mountain Dew brand, which posted double-digit growth.\nPepsiCo said results also were affected by increased spending for advertising, marketing and placement of new vendors and cold bottle equipment to help build brand recognition.\nPepsiCo said international beverages posted an $11 million profit after three quarters of losses from ongoing operations.\nCase sales fell 2 percent from the prior year, primarily due to the loss of the company's Venezuelan bottler last year. It said new bottler Empresas Polar has added capacity and has accelerated re-entry into the market in Venezuela.\nIn snack foods, PepsiCo said North American profit grew 11 percent due to margin enhancement and volume growth. It cited strong growth in Tostitos and Doritos.\nInternationally, the snack business posted an 11 percent increase in sales and operating profit growth of 12 percent. Volume gains were led by Sabritas, PepsiCo's Mexican snack business, and by Brazilian snack company Elma Chips.\nThe company said its worldwide restaurant business posted a solid second quarter. The U.S. business recorded an 8 percent profit growth, but lower revenues, reflecting fewer stores. Pepsico operates Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell restaurants.\nPepsiCo also said the newly named restaurant company TRICON has gained momentum as it moves toward a spin-off later in the year.\n","classes":[15,16,44],"classes_pad":null}

Police said he abducted, pistol-whipped, raped and strangled the 44-year-old secretary before dumping her body in a field.\nO'Dell was arrested after leaving bloody clothing at a girlfriend's house. She turned him in after learning the slaying had occurred in an area that O'Dell frequented.\nThe case was one of the costliest in Virginia history by the time of his 1986 conviction. But it has since become possibly the most contentious capital murder case in the state's history.\nAnd, although he has no ties to Italy, O'Dell has become a cause celebre there.\nPope John Paul and Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi have led a chorus of protest against his death sentence. On Monday alone, the Vatican's television station made an plea for clemency and Prodi told reporters in Luxemburg he had made \"a last, very strong, heartfelt appeal\" to Allen.\nItalian officials met Allen's counsel Mark Christie on Monday and asked him to permit a new DNA test.\n\"I think nobody can say that he is sure Joseph O'Dell is guilty,\" said Leoluca Orlando, mayor of Palermo and a member of the European Parliament. \"I hope that Governor Allen will stop this execution.\nAllen, a Republican known for his vigorous anti-crime stance, has said he believes O'Dell is guilty and has refused to allow new DNA testing in the case.\nThe condemned man's supporters have questioned the testing. A DNA test done on O'Dell's shirt in 1990 showed that blood on it did not belong to O'Dell or Schartner. But tests on the blood on his jacket showed by odds of 166,000 to one that the blood was Schartner's.\nO'Dell is represented by Washington and New York law firms as well as a New York public relations agency. His \"spiritual advisor\" is Sister Helen Prejean, author of \"Dead Man Walking,\" the best-selling book that was made into a movie.\nLori Urs, a paralegal who is a close friend of O'Dell, said she had met with him for an hour on Monday and that he was holding up well.\n\"He's an inspiration to me,\" she said. \"Joe has faith, continues to hope and pray that the governor will grant him a reprieve.\"\nBut Schartner's sister, Gail Lee of Virginia Beach, said the family was weary of the long process.\n\"We're surviving (though) it's getting a little rough,\" she said, recounting telephone calls from Italian journalists.\nThere were eight executions in Virginia last year, the most of any U.S. state. This year, three people have been put to death in the state.\nO'Dell's execution had been scheduled for last December 18, but was stayed that day by the U.S. Supreme Court so it could consider whether to apply to the case its 1994 ruling that jury's must be told when the alternative sentence to execution is life without chance of parole.\nWhen O'Dell was sentenced, he was forbidden by Virginia law from telling jurors that if they gave him life instead of death he would never be eligible for parole because he already had a lengthy criminal record which includes arrests for a break-in, auto thefts, assaults, an attempted escape from prison, armed robberies and a second-degree murder.\nBut the High Court ruled against O'Dell in a 5-4 vote last month, paving the way for Wednesday's execution.\n","classes":[90,91,93,106],"classes_pad":null}
